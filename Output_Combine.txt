I 9miss 1you a lot Sarah Spicer .. I 2 posted a pic of your eyes.. 3Just know I 9think about you 9and I 8miss you 2lots .. Sorry3 for being an 4asshole but we all make mistakes .. I really do love you and I ca n't give up hope that at the least we will be friends .. I ca n't quit my soul wo n't let me Hi , You were very short and hot with a tiny skirt . We made a comment or two , tell me about what . But I want to meet if you are out there reading . Why are you doing this ? Is it entertaining for you ? Do you feel it 's somehow deserved ? Because she 's hot , a goddess , then she deserves to be objectified and written off of a person lacking in substance , unworthy of respect , of love ? I think you should step outside of your ego and take into consideration how your callousness can truly affect others . It 's not a game . About 12:30 today ( may 27 ) ... We were waiting for our orders and chatted a little. You were wearing a maroon sweater , black leggings and light brown Uggs . You have jet black hair with a couple of Bobby pins holding the side stragglers up , and an amazingly beautiful smile with full and oh so kissable ruby lips. In the hope you were also interested I 'm putting this message in a bottle for you. Have a great week ! ! You were sitting for a while in front of Keypoint when I walked by and then I happened to see you again at the Safeway entrance . I said hi but wish I could have thought of something more and interesting to say ... I was the guy with brown hair and beige shirt . You looked friendly , I would n't mind having a longer conversation : - ) Love , R. He moves his hips to the side a little bit and allows her knees room for leverage . She pulls her t-shirt up and over her head . Catching her hair , it falls behind her as she reaches to unhook her bra . The candlelight plays in images across her round breasts and flaccid nipples . She leans forward , placing one nipple to his wet lips as she pulls her pants off . First with one arm , then the other , she works the fabric down from her ankles until she is lying completely atop of him in nothing but cotton panties . He loves her creamy white skin and blinks hard to catch glimpses of her curves in the dim lighting . We met up at a study today , i thought you were pretty cute , you were awfully talkative and always seemed to have something to say . I would like to hang out , just chill and shit . You seem like you 'd make a cool friend Hey , Last night ( Tuesday , 5/26 ) , in the evening , we both were in the back-room on a mini platform watching the other guys going at it . Then , two guys came up to us , blew us and all eyes were on us . I noticed that you were the same guy when we both checked in at the same time ( I was behind you waiting for my turn to check in ) . You 're cute and I wished we could have done more together.. Perhaps again next time ? Tell me what I was wearing or what were you wearing when we checked in , so I know it 's you . Hope to hear from you . Hello ladies , I 'm a handsome man who loves to pleassure women . I am sweet and kind , someone who loves to give and make women happy . I have been recently tested and am DDF . I also have had a vasectomy . I would like you to also be DDF . We picked you up last and dropped me off first . We chatted about our careers and how mine could benifet yours . We takes politics and a little of our personal lives . Would love to reconnect . Let me know what ur career was and of course you 're name ; ) Xx Look what this girl done did to me She done cut me off from a good , good love She told me that those days were gone Gone , gone Now I 'm sitting here goin ' half crazy 'Cause I know she still thinks about me , too And it ai n't no way in hell That I can be just friends with you ... ... ... ... ... .. And I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends ... .no The way it felt , no fakin ' it Maybe we were movin ' just a little too fast But what we 've done , we ca n't take it back Back , back ... no Now I 'm sitting here halfway crazy 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too And it ai n't no way in hell That I can be just friends with you ... ..no And I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends Ai n't no tellin ' what we could 've been Ai n't no tellin ' what we could 've been , ... . no And if I knew it end like this I never would 've kissed ya 'Cause I fell in love with ya We never would 've kicked it Girl , now everything 's different I lost my only lover and my friend That 's why I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends ... ... ... ... ... .. Today , I was buying some stuff and I saw you girl walking on the same aisle , you were talking on the phone as you passed behind me I wanted to say you had beautiful eyes , but I reacted kind of slow . I was the latino construction guy wearing a cap . Man you were cute , I walked around the store and I did n't saw you anymore you were gone . In the unlikely event that you see this ad contact me , I want to tell you and not keep it inside me : ) . I can tell you what you were wearing , just to be sure it 's you . Two years later . Well almost three . I ca n't forget you . I know you 're living in sin with her , and she 'll bankrupt you into having a baby . You did n't want complications so it 's ironic you are catering to her wanting a baby . It will get old . Then you will cheat on her like you did with me , with your wife , with every girl that has crossed your path . Cheaters do n't change , but I still care about you . I still am in love with you . I keep wondering how you are . If you ever find yourself lonely ( and you will , trust me ) and need someone , I 'm here . I will always be waiting for you . my friends joke around with me , refer to you as my boyfriend . my crush is so big and obvious . if i did n't have scruples i 'd try to make something happen . but we 're both married with kiddos so it will never be . too sticky . plus you seem much too noble to ever even go there . i like that about you but at the same time it makes me want defile you all night long ... . you 're the hottest dad around though . i just had to get it outta my head . mc seems like the most appropriate place to do that . Smooth Latino bottom in room 204 . You had the nicest bubble butt I ever fucked . I have never licked a men 's ass but I want to like yours . Tell me who did I tell you I was imagining you being ? Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance , Saturday , May 23 , Wischemann Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect .

And yesterday I realized , that there 's something else that I like about Logos as well . You 're about 6 ' 1 - I 'd guess b/c I 'm 6 ' and you look a little taller - w long dark hair in a center part that comes down past your shoulders and you wear studious sort of glasses . Yesterday you had on jeans and a button down . You look close to my age ( I 'm 31 ) and you 've got a lean , cowboy kind of build , but look like the kind of guy who goes home to Thelonious Monk and Thomas Pynchon . I think you 've worked at Logos for some years now - 3 ? - but yesterday when you guided me to Dark Sun the history of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes I felt a little flutter in my heart that had nothing to do with nuclear energy. I do n't live in Santa Cruz ( Oakland is my home ) but if I did , I 'd come up with a lot more books for you to help me find . I 'm usually in SC once a month . And you might not be the kind of guy that 's into guys . But I am . And if you are too , I 'd love to buy you coffee sometime . Or even if you 're hetero , I know we both love books , so we 'll still have something to talk about . : ) We are a team of elite movers and shakers in Tech . We were in contact with the most excellent problem solver and reframer in the history of mankind but lost her email . Can you help us ? She just looks amazing in those boots and that 's definitely why we messed up -- it 's a scientific fact that our brains do n't work . All we remember is that she is HOT and a GODDESS but ca n't fill in any other freakin ' details ! ! ! ! Please help us ... .. you will know when you run into her because you will think she is incompetent I 'm missing you , my lovely shoreline park friend .

You are in SF area and saw my profile on Ashley Madison . I knew you 'll search here for me . Let 's connect ; - ) At least you said you were . You know who you are . Are you still out there playing ? I did not think it would be this hard to have no contact with you. Please let me know how things are going for you . I hope you are happy. Still love you. Your Lobster Exchanged some looks and smiles in Pegasus on Memorial Day ... .should have talked to you ? I was making fun of my friend and we all smiled . Well , email might work better . This could be for anyone . Or do you mean for the billion or so readers that we are all too late ? Not sure if you decided not to chat more , or if the temporary Craigslist email addresses expired. Either Way , could you get a hold of me so I know ? Dennis I asked how mans sets you had left . You are very sexy and I 'd like to get together . If you see this and are interested , let me know what machine and how many set you had . The happiest place on earth was inside your heart and especially inside your mouth , vagina and anus - you hot Pinay . I should have married you . You are a voluptuous white woman wearing jeans and red tshirt that said `` Application ? Driving a gray color mini truck. Me white man pumping gas at booth island. You are probably taken , but if not where do I fill out that application ? I got it bad for you . I should have approached you but I saw movement in the front seat so I held my ground . When you drove away , there was a nice looking brindle pit with you . I Wish I would have known . We 'd probably be talking right now . It 's been awhile and I lost your contact info . I would love to see you again . You work in Napa area and I work in Sebastopol area . If this is you , name the PARK we met at . It is a challenge to connect with a stranger during a crowded BART commute . This morning I wanted to say hi to you . I tried to do it with my eyes , but that was n't quite enough. You have a nice open face . You got off at Montgomery at about 9:20 . Black pants , black boots to your knee , black blazer , black and white stripped shirt . What was distinctive ? The stud earring in your upper left ear . I was wearing a green shirt with a tie . We both are married and good friends ( you are good friend of my wife ) . We both know that we want each other but could n't say it openly ( though you mentioned in a party on the weekend that you have hearts for me ... you were drunk ) . You are petite and I am tall Indian guy . We both think a like and very practical . I badly want you ... you have no idea how many times I fantasized about you . Will you we able to keep it a secret and enjoy ? Hope you see this and reply back . I am N and you are M. We passed each other outside the doors at Palace Art & amp ; Supply in Capitola on Monday afternoon . You were super cute , black hair , nose ring , jeans , etc , and scowling , I was scowling too . Mine was for my current project sapping the life force out of me , which is why I fumbled until you had passed . Maybe yours was for a similar art project or at the bright sun , or at me . Maybe we can inspire each other . Maybe we can go get supplies at the same time next week ? Moving his hand from her face , he caresses her long hair . Taking the lightest dark locks in between his fingers , he twirls these parts of her fast until they pull taut and fall back to her shoulders . He enjoys this game , pulling her to him in these small bits until , slightly tortured , she falls back to her own side . He touches her soft cheek , hoping that touch will suffice for words until he has time to think things through . She smiles , happily accepting the affectionate gesture from her new lover . The brightness in her eyes takes him almost by surprise . She never seems to smile anymore . `` Dammit , he tells himself , `` Kiss her , hug her or something . . . . Either response would be too simple to explain the complexity of emotions he feels for her . She yields to his desire , turning her head to the other side and exposing her untouched skin . Deliberately , he runs the flat of his wet tongue over the salt of her neck . He does n't bite yet , but moves over her until she lies flat on top of the lumped up bed covers . From this pinned position , she comes alive . Moving only her hands , she manages to pull his t-shirt out of his belt and half way up over his back . She runs her tiny hands over the warmed , exposed skin and kisses him with a passion incomparable to that of his deviant biting . Her strong thighs wrap around his waist , pulling him to her in one swift surge . Whatever her doubts and insecurities were , she finds no solace in her concerns . Rather , she rolls over with him until she is in a half sitting position on top of his clothed body . Ravenously , she kisses him with vengeance until the saliva from within her cheeks drips easily from his slick lips . To the super cute woman I bumped into twice at two places in 10 mins , I was thoroughly charmed and I am now painfully bewitched ... Wanted to ask you to lunch but was too late in the parking lot ... . Write to me , you cutie : ) This seldom happens to me , but man it did today ! You rang me up this afternoon at ACE Hardware in Sebastopol . I saw a quick glimpse of your eyes during a typical friendly exchange at first , and could n't believe what I saw. No ... ..could n't be ... ... . But it so was true ! The biggest hazel deep green , sparkly , fantastically incredible gorgeous eyes I 've even seen ! We looked at each other as I gave you some cash , I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the money thing . Then you gave me change , I think I may have said have a great afternoon , but I locked onto , and into those perfectly clear pools of hypnotic green for what seemed like minutes ! And heres the part that seldom happens to me , they stayed with me all day and into the evening ! Like I had just left you moments ago ! I could so look at those eyes again ! Thank you ! Crossed paths at the Mexican market there Miller Ave. on Monday I think . I was next in line behind you . Would like to sit and have coffee with you , my treat . You were also wearing a black tank top . I was in the vehicle with writing on it . Sat across from you and your friend at Starbucks Monday morning . You : tall , tight gray shorts ... I 'm guessing from San Francisco . Saw you again Tuesday morning . Hit me up . We sat next to each other at the bar and talked a little bit . We made a bet on the warriors game . I thought you were really attractive , but I did n't get your number . If you see this , let me know the details of our bet ! Long shot , but we played for a few minutes at the Jacks party last night . We were both in the lobby afterwards . As you were leaving , I think you said `` Thanks for letting me join . You looked like someone I knew from Atlanta . If that was you ... would love to get in touch . Ellen we bought your Suburu Blue wagon around 4 month 's ago ?

She holds his hand by the tips of his fingers and enjoys feeling the familiar bend in his hand as he lights candles with his other hand . Fumbling , he places the candle atop the desk and moves her to his bed. She sits , patiently attentive to her thoughts , on top of the jumbled bed clothes and watches him take off his shoes with delicate balance . Holding her face , he kisses her on both cheeks before removing her glasses and placing them on the nightstand . The kisses feel good to her and she enjoys the warm breath on her goospimpled skin . Again , he kisses her softly on the face as he moves his stubbled framed mouth to her smooth lips . She pulls back slightly , startled at the roughness of his three day beard , but resumes relaxation as his kisses move from her mouth to her neck . I asked you for a light you told me the night before you drank way too much I told you how to cure that. Your BF is a bartender. I saw you glancing after we talked outside. I was looking too. I 'll have to have more dreams about `` what if ... How do i ask u to ? How do I suppress my selfish need to explore other sexual experiences while wanting u all to myself . I want to make out and cuddle with her then come home and fall deeper in love with u. I need a reboot once in a while from a real throbbing penis , but have no desire to commit to a man . We have been through so much and when my dying day comes I wanthyou holding my hand , raising our children . I 'm asking u to be stronger than me , I 'm askingbyou to let me wander while you stay faithful to me ! She gently tosses her head to one side and the dim light catches under her eyes in what almost seems to be a leery , ominous glow of intensity . He ca n't tell if she is still smiling because her face is tilted slightly to one side , but he can hear her unsure , off rhythm breath clearly . `` Come on he says , gently pulling her up from her knees . He knows he 's taking a chance with her since he 's not quite sure where they stand , but the moment is too much for him to ignore . She stands slowly , not quite sure what she thinks of the situation -- of him -- but follows him into the bedroom . and wonder is he looking at at it too ? Will he return your text if you contacted him ? What would he say if you showed up at his door ? You miss at how his hugs and caresses melted your problems away even if it was for a few days. You miss at how his flirting , laughter made you smile , laugh and brought you joy. You miss at how he magically would make the darkness disappear for a while. You miss at how his passionate kisses would make your toes curl. Then you realize , the reason he is not there still exists. He wanted more than you were willing to give. He was unwilling to accept less than he wanted. He was tired of being pushed away every time you felt the need to run away. He was tired of being the one you called only when you felt abandoned by others. You do not miss that he easily brought you sadness when he pushed back as you push him away. Sometimes events , people remind him of you like someone did last night . Sometimes events , people remind you of him . Sometimes you just want to snuggle up to him one last time , see if the fire and passion are in his kisses ... Looking for another sister CD to live with in santa rosa as a roommate.

SEND e-mail with pic so we can start this. Room is ready 6-1-15. You were by yourself , leaving as I was going in . You definitely looked at me and smiled , I thought you were very pretty and would like to say `` Hi and get to know you . I am older . I did n't mean to be rude by walking by without saying anything . You looked nervous , really pretty but nervous . I wanted to say something but I get it . Well I do n't understand any of it but I 'm not trying to come at you if you do n't want me to . I still hope you would hit me up . Hey today I walked in and ordered a drink . You were the cute cashier . With curly brownish hair and a cute smile . I thought you were hot . starbucks on capitol expressway and McLaughlin . were both the same age it was around 11.20 . You were a cute , fun loving woman dancing samba by the water ; ) . You can shake ! Was torn between watching your sensual moves or your radiant smile when you danced . You were there with friends . We smiled , we talked after the event . I wanted to dance with you later that night but you had someone. We share a mutual acquaintance , used to live in the same city , enjoyed a witty quick conversation that ended too soon. Long shot , but hey better than not trying . Christine , I 've thought about you a lot over the years and I think we really could have made a great couple . Do you believe in second chances ? We could be great together . -T Last saw you a couple of weeks ago . We were supposed to hang out again . Where did you disappear to ? You seemed like a great gal who loves the outdoors , we talked for a minute and then continued on . I think we met on Rough Go . Woe to me for not saying more ! But now I am asking , would you like to meet again , for a hike , or a drink , or both ? : ) You introduced yourself as Crystal and partnered with me at the ballroom dance lessons , and you showed me how to Waltz . I was n't planning to go to the Ball but I went in hopes of seeing you again . We danced even though I did n't know how to dance , and I told you that I was really only there so I would have a chance to dance with you again . I realized afterwards that was a mistake because of how awkward it made things . I 'm sorry I made you so uncomfortable . I hope you still had a great rest of the night , and that you find someone who treats you right because I think you are very special . Hi Corey. You were at the Cafe with friends . I was looking at the apartment ads when you were out having a cigarette . this was about 830pm . Should have given you my phone number then . Lets meet up ! Just tell me where you live , so I know it is you . I exist now dreaming in reality , shades of deep reds and grays , Evolving at the speed of light As my third eye sees all , I bring my fingers to my lips and time stops I taste you. I ponder you and wallow in the memory of your scent and way. How you called me baby The way you made me laugh The way you touched my heart and made me believe Unable to stop , it seems too wonderful , but in the end there is not much but pain. I allow this for some time , then I awake and know that I am alive and the possibilities are endless. Wanting you to taste my soul and undeniably know that I am the one and we are one to conquer happiness together , unimaginably , the way you knew that we could and will if you say one word , Yes ! Your fear . Your ego . Your pride . They protect and also hurt you , keeping you from what is rightfully yours , Love. If I had your heart again ? Oh , the way I would touch it , nurture it and protect it My most sacred gift God wants what I want , he trusts me and knows my light is pure as he does you. Say the word once. The heavens will open up and the angels will sing in our praise Because we chose. Please do n't be afraid , I am always here for you. I 'LL MISS YOU IM LEAVING THE U.S .

I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE TO MEET A PERSON AND START A FRIENDSHIP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GOES FROM THERE . Saw you on the bench reading and picking your nose . I walked by several times to get your attention but you seemed preoccupied with the nose thing . I had on grey shorts and tennies . Tell me where the bench was to make sure it 's you . I left work because you freed me from it . I had it all along - you ! My knowledge -- & gt ; wisdom -- & gt ; success w/o you ? = uncertainty You : I love you. Me : I love you more.

You are so beautiful Hispanic woman with black or brown curly hair and a lovely smile I was breathtaking . I did n't have time to say something and I did n't want to get you in to trouble . But I enjoyed locking eyes and smile with you . If you see this I would like to get together and go for coffee or Ice cream together or something . I miss the way you closed your eyes when I kissed you. I wish I could kiss you again . Wow , I did n't think anything about meeting someone at the drive thru , then I got to the window , we shared a little bit , and then I left . I have n't stopped thinking about you , I think we had a connection . I you feel the same message me back , put the name of the restaurant in the subject line , hope to hear from you soon . As I was leaving the farmers market , you were getting out of your car and then getting stuff out of the passenger 's side . You were wearing these navy yoga pants , and you were arcing your back and bending your hips in just such a way ... well , I could n't not stare . And I know you caught me staring ( off the reflection on your car ) . So - first , sorry for staring . Second , if it 's not weird to say , thank you . Your butt was the highlight of my day . Absolutely incredible ; ) If you write , tell me what color and make your car is. I posted here in a time of weakness and pain . You used it as an opportunity to judge me and browbeat me with your evangelical Christian brainwashing . You judged me as being in pain because I needed Jesus . You are dangerously misinformed about your own outer religion . when I responded to thank you but point out Mathhew 6:5 - do n't be like the hypocrites - and the Book of Job - bad things happen to great people and you should n't judge - you flew into a rage . This has happened three other times that I 've posted here . I did not ask for help or to be evangelized . I was merely telling my story . You use Jesus to aggrandize your own ego . I 'm literally thinking every day of killing myself and you are out there trying to make me feel even worse about myself through your idea of religion . You get a good feeling out of telling other people you are holier than they are when they are down . You are just awful . I should be free FROM your religion . Hey We chatted at the bar , your name was Hannah and you said you teach in San Mateo . I wish I had asked you out , but you left ... .. You were going to see Dior and I , I was in the lobby waiting for friends . We smiled and said hello . Would love to meet you . We could not keep our eyes from eachother ... You in your black leather jacket and kids , me in black shirt and jeans . I tried to figure out a way to come introduce myself but you seemed to be with your family ! You 'll never see this I 'm sure but just for fun You were in the yellow muscle shirt . I was staring and admiring your beautiful , large hard pecs . You smiled big at me , and I got embarrassed . I 'm working on that -- should have said hi . Hi ? We met on the beach with our dogs . I told you I loved red hair . When you told me you were a high school teacher I told you the boys must be hot for you . You said you were stressed from finals . I can help . We can go to nude beach and be totally free and relaxed then my place where I have massage table for a sensual full body massage then I would give you totally oral bliss . And that just the beginning BABY , I AM SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW I TREATED YOU.LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS NO GOOD , YOUR MY SUNSHINE , MY BABY GIRL .I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AND START NEW ! I COULD TYPE FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT I WISH OR WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD RATHER BE LOOKING INTO YOUR SEXY BROWN EYES AND TELLING YOU INPERSON ... .THIS SUCKS BABY : I NEED YOU , WANT YOU , MISS YOU ! GIVE ME A CHANCE AND HEAR ME OUT , PLEASE ... ... IF YOU READ THIS , CALL ME SO WE CAN TALK , PLEASE ! OR EMAIL ME ! SO I KNOW ITS YOU , WERE WAS OUR FIRST KISS ? ? ? ? ? ? Ps ... ... i love you baby ! Leoncio Navarro i really want to see you . If your attached or not . Please find me . T I have moments in my day when I think about us . I do n't cry anymore , sigh at times and maybe clear my throat , but it 's not at all like the first time . I have realized that the greatest gift you gave me was the lesson in loving myself and realizing my worth . It may have come at a cost , because in that very process I learned that our failures were not worth carrying around but rather to be placed under my feet and used as stepping stones to something better. I ca n't begin to tell you how many times I have ended something with someone simply because your voice echoes in my head `` you are better than that , you deserve more I always credit you for my change of behavior and even though it makes me want to scream at times , I am most pleased with the outcome : - ) your love paved the way to a healthier me and I needed you to know that it was not all for nothing ! In some attempts , it is glorious even to fail I saw you in Carls Jr in Martinez SATURDAY about 6 or 7pm . You were with another girl & amp ; some young dude . You had pushed a baby stroller to your table . When I first saw you , I was so hooked . I could n't take my eyes off you . I left a note for you to find , I pray . Then when I drove away , past the window where you were sitting , ... you and the other chick were totally staring at me , & amp ; both of you were waving at me .

CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME ! So , you were at 90 's night tonight and you were by far the coolest human there . Your moves were solid across the board , and you were clearly there for the music , not to hook up , which is why I Ieft you way the hell alone ( also : social anxiety ) . BUT ( and this is a big but ) , it maybe seemed like you could be could be interested , or maybe I am totally off base . You were present , but , like , never actively pursuing , so it 's hard to tell . Anyway , um , you had light jeans on and a tight black top that really highlighted your quite exquisite back . I was just , you know , a white human , black shirt , basically the most boring thing ever . But I promise I am at least a little cool , if you did want to reach out . K. Good night . Too weak and tired to write much tonight ; why is my muse not bringing me coffee and rolling me with a rolling pin ? It 's in the job description . Anyhow , this is the best I can do tonight , despite all the beautiful women in the world ... : -/ The nIght of the hot red things I 've seen big cafeterias And vaulted marble ceilings , I 've seen dark things mysterious And people with no feelings I 've seen bright fields of roses And golden onion domes , I 've seen misshapen noses , And brand new mobile homes I 've seen two tits to die for , And Martin Luther King , I 've seen San Bernardino , And damn near everything ! But something that I 'm missing Which it seems I need to see , Is a year or two of kissing you , In the third degree ! Three More Bloody Haikuses Not infrequently I feel like I will die Love is a life boat Thinking of your face At times when you look happy Helps me to survive Following one 's heart Leads one through flaming canyons And down to the beach If I need you more than I want you ...

Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance tonight , Saturday , May 23 , Wischelman Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect . I 'm looking for a cute , sweet and drop-dead gorgeous girl whose name is Dulce who was a manager at a Carl 's Jrs at 1999 Camden Ave ( San Jose , CA ) with Marylou . Dulce speaks Spanish as well. I do n't want to flirt nor date . I just want to say hi and know how is she doing. Hi , Dulce . You worked at Carls Jrs ( Union and Camden ) I ate there almost every weekend since November 2012 till December 2013. Dulce , you probably remember me . You sighed virtually every time you saw me . How are you ? You were upstairs having a drink with your friends sitting on a stool overlooking the drunk dancers . You wore glasses and a white top and I could just tell you had a good vibe to you . Would love to get to know you better . You came in looking for a restroom..Then came back with a smile to update me..I wish we had just a minute longer I 'm wondering if you saw me ? I thought maybe you were looking into my eyes , because I Was looking into yours . I was inside and you were walking by with a friend . I looked thru the window and between the fence , you were wearing black fitness pants with a yellowish top and a Scarlett scarf/headband . If you saw me ? Let me know . Never thought I 'd see my girl til I saw you tonight . You were at the corner of 23rd and Castro making a left , listening to Pac and smoking a cigarette . You stopped me in my tracks and I could n't look away . I was walking up 23rd backwards looking at you take a drag off that smoke while you made the left . Silver Hyundai . How many girls listen to Pac rolling around by themselves ? If you saw me let me know and tell me what I was wearing . If you see this and you do n't wan na reach out I just got ta say keep doin you , it looks like it 's working . You know no one does it it like you . When I was sad , I let myself be sad . Well I guess it 's time to be happy . You fill my dreams and nightmares . Let me taste you , my longing for you as I grip my knees on either side of you . Let me make it up to you . I wish the best for you . I was really good to you . I just love your secret smile . I do n't think I 'll post here again . I 'm in a place of peace and hope . I am even more puzzled , than hurt . It 's a real shame too . It 's just something I 'd do for you . Hear me moan as you take a fist of my hair in one hand my flesh in the other . Have a nice life . Have a great weekend ! Be kind to me . As I said , there is someone waiting for me out there . All the love I felt but could n't express . All pain and nothing about it . Accept it and cherish it . Sat for an hour and a half trying to work up to go in and ask you out . I do n't think you 've realized it but every single time ive walked into your jobs , this and the one before and unless im mistaken theres one that was before that but I just liked to go and kinda check you out , its been with the intent to ask you out on a date . I really suck at it . I see you almost daily at World Gym and we exchange smiles every now and then . I wish I can say more or be any more descriptive , but if I did I 'll reveal who you are . If you think it is you that I am talking about , send me an email with what you were wearing at the gym today . Hi Cutie , You were sitting next to me at a stop light and you reached back to roll the window down so your son could say hi to me. HMU -- let 's chat . We had some hot fun a month or two again and I 'd love to feed you my cock again . I loved your submissive and how you too my thick cock Respond back with what we did and how you look so I know its you Hope to hear from you ; I donthave grindr anymore so lost contact I hope , I hope you see this . I was sitting at the window counter sipping an iced tea and reading . You were in line and then you sat next to me while you waited for your drink . I could n't think of anything to say but what I wanted to say was . `` hi , I love you hair Cute boots. You look to be about 50-55 grey hair , stocky build ... .you were wearing nice blue plaid type shirt and had your face buried in the paper . We exchanged glances a few times I thought you were very nice looking , any way if you are into guys and remember my greeting , say hello and see where this nice bottom guy can take you ... . If the stars align perhaps we can meet again ... ... . Damn this short attention span I was perfectly content on my island , but you came in like a monsoon , sucking me out to sea . Floating in the warmth of your intentions . The calm winds began to change , sputtering gusts at first . Tropical blasts battered followed by arctic chills sending me so off course there was no hope of finding my way back . Now I 'm left adrift , watching the compass spin , knowing that the next rush will be the final blow that drowns me . Please just put me back where you found me . Good looking tall black guy wearing scrubs and a jacket . Made eye contact several times . Discreet professional white guy here standing across from you . Would love to connect if you see this . Let me know what was on your jacket so I know it 's you . I know I probably enjoyed that just as much , if not more than you . i wanted to add a few sweet little kisses in here and there on your neck and shoulder area but it would have been a little bit improper.i hope you take me up on my offer , a little bit of privacy and better setting will make a world 's difference . i promise to remain a complete gentleman the entire time and respect any limitations you may have.just keep in mind im willing to go the extra mile ... ... . Just wondering how many women have been left in the wake of your desires ? How many times have you walked the line of improper with promises of respect and being a gentleman ? Do you really know what going the extra mile means ? Does the road trip end when you get to add those `` sweet kisses or to quite when it gets real ?

Each day I get on BART , I see you when you get on at Orinda before we head into the tunnel towards SF , you stand right by the door , heading I know not where , I 'd like to be able to say something to you , even a hi , but I 'm too shy to . I 'm the one with the bike and the bike clothes , sitting there in the seat wishing I could just say something , but then Embarcadero comes and I have to get off because I 'm going to work , flying around the city , delivering goods . I would love to actually get to talk to you , but this biker is very shy . I do n't know if you 'll be there the next time I ride and each time I can only hope . Please be that Hope . you just got to your parked car and I was walking by.. you put your backpack in the trunk , put money in the meter and then passed me.. when you walked towards me you said `` helllo.. or how are you I said hello back . I watched you walk down the street . man.. you are so handsome . In the unlikely event that you see this.. email me so we can meet for coffee sometime . Hello there , you like being outdoors and hiking on trails and need a new friend to talk to , I am a working guy who would like to meet another easygoing person to get to know better and have some hiking fun on the weekends . I am looking for relationship and love ... . You Latin looking bear with that hot beard hanging around at closing . Me stocky masculine bearded white linebacker who wanted to seriously put your legs over my shoulders and make you beg . This is a long shot but if you are out there reading this and interested HMU. Tell me what it is about your beard that is different so I know it 's you . 24 Hour Fitness , SuperSport on Crane To the cute girl with glasses jogging around between sets , I 'm glad you took an extra lap by me as I was finishing up . Definitely gave me something to remember this weekend. Not my usual gym or workout time , but maybe I 'll see you around I wanted to pullover to talk to you . You are VERY sexy . If this is you , and you 're interested , please reply and tell me what my vehicle was so I know it was you . I just wanted to say thank you for your compassion . My girlfriend and I were there with our dog who we ended up having to let go . From the exam room I heard the tech apologizing for the wait and could hear you saying it was no problem , that you understood ... I would like to think that most people in your shoes would feel the same way , but working in a veterinary hospital myself , I know that people can be amazingly insensitive and selfish when made to wait under similar circumstances . So thank you so much for your kindness , patience , and compassion . I hope your dog is okay , he was really cute and under any other circumstances I would have given him all the attention he seemed to want from us ! Take care , and please know that your small kindness made a big difference to us on that very painful night . As I came out of Trader Joes you were there with your children and you looked at me like you knew me and you said Hi and you took my breath you were so beautiful . I am pretty sure I said Hi back but I walked straight to my car . OMG you were so beautiful and I ca n't shake that feeling that you must know me . as God is my witness , love will prevail . I have you in my sights , and , to quote our nasal friend Mr. Declan P. MacManus , `` My aim is true ! `` C. x S. I had suitcases , you had ( blank ) . Very sexy eyes , gave me great thoughts through the day ... . You- Beauty in a light blue suv. Me- Red shirt , white truck. I should n't have gotten off at my exit ... You had no makeup on , white shirt with black yoga pants . You have a beautiful face . I was by you on bart with a grey sweatshirt . Lets talk ... .email me and tell me its you by saying what oakland stop you got off at ... . I know this is a long shot but you were wearing a north face coat earlier this week . I saw you by bart , you had glasses on . This is to just say hi and maybe become friends , nothing else , you look like you have a lot on your mind and could use a person to talk to . I dont have any ill intentions just friends . I am a man and would respect any situation your in . I saw this couple near Mission/15th and the male was being very aggressive and looked like he was about to be abusive . I 'd really like to know whether this was a school experiment to see what passersby would say . It freaked me out and I 'd like to ease my mind . ( I did yell at him that I 'd taken his picture so he better not hurt her but I had kids in the car so I felt I could n't do more . ) You look fancy in that somewhat short green skirt . You got good legs and an attractive look and physique . I got into pumping gas seeing you were pumping gas in the pump near De Anza Park : ) Seems you noticed I looked at you - may be not , could not be sure. You are pretty. I 've seen you while riding my bike down Shattuck while you wait for the 18 . I have seen you a few times on the 18 towards Albany/Solano , also . You usually get on somewhere around Alcatraz , I think , sometimes on Ashby. We 've smiled at each other pleasantly , though I 've always wanted to strike up a conversation with you , despite you wearing headphones ( and I recognize that 's maybe the point of wearing them and I do not fault you for wanting to be left alone on public transit ) . I 'm a tall , bearded , glasses-wearing goober who is often reading or slipping back and forth between awake and asleep thanks to the early hour and the warm bus ride . I think we 'd get along , though I ca n't really say why. Would you be interested in getting a pint or a tumbler or a cuppa something sometime ? I would relish the opportunity to get to know you better . Hi , Beautiful girl who was sitting next to me on IHSS Orientation at 1 pm today . You left your SS card in the car . Please get back to me if you read this. Greg Easily the prettiest/hottest/sexiest woman I think I have ever seen ! Seriously . Super model style . Anyone else notice how perfect that woman was ? Grey denim . Bun . Painted toes . Trying my best to be respectful. Anyways , made my day as I stood in that shitty line . So big thanks , to the brunette who , I 'm assuming is a model . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . * I do n't take much shit from ladies , *even the sexy/hot girls . EVER . I would let this woman walk all over me like a loser . Actually I would n't . But some dude is a lucky S.O.B. This is whats up to that cute ass asian working out at the Fremont 24 by Bart around the noon time . Just saying whats up tho . I have n't seen you in so long . I 've made too many mistakes to make it right . I hope you 're doing well . I love you ... forever I 'm lost for words . Yes , me . I know it took a lot for you to do that . Thank you but just know that I 'm trying to make `` sense of it . Even though I do n't think `` sense has anything to do with this ( smile ) . I will admit , you scare me a little bit , but in a good way . Please be patient with me , I do n't know what to do and that is the truth. I was the gent that waved to you and thought that you were so wonderful ! I am hoping if you are single that you would go out with me for a coffee date ? If interested let me know ok ... ... . sincerely me ... . You get me off the equipment I was using so you could complete your routine I would love to get to know you better and i wish you end up reading this Tell me which equipment I was using I 'm looking to find and reconnect with you , we met and went on a couple dates . You were really nice and pretty . Curvy , had a nose ring , pretty short hair from what I remember and tattoos . Things ended but I wish they did n't . Please reply . You 've recently worked with my family putting in a sport court . I 'm not really the type to post something like this but you 've been on my mind ever since you came by to show us your tiles . I 've heard through the grapevine that your a divorced dad of one . Is there any chance you 'd be interested in a divorced mom of one ? I 'm secure , sane , and your sense of humor is right up my ally . I hope I hear back . I 'm mixed black and white , short hair , glasses and beard You said your name was _hil , ''like Phil , but with a _ . and that you were headed to Temescal to meet with some friends. You were kind of tall and handsome and had a very mellow and confident demeanor and you had a skirt on . I said I smoked too much weed .

Thanks for letting me know I almost forgot my plant ! Coffee sometime ? ... that after three grueling years I may have finally turned the corner health-wise . A misread MRI and a therapist who knows the correct course of treatment give me hope where there was none . So this is a good chance to thank you for the support you have given me in your own special way . It 's been nothing short of astonishing ... I literally do n't know how I would have survived without you . I truly do n't know where your heart lies , I think you can feel my confusion when I go off on one of my jackass rifts ... if it 's with someone else , that makes your support of me even more amazing . You are an angel , one sent here to help me through my darkest hour and if I can ever do anything for you all you need do is pick up the phone . Whoever you love is the luckiest person on the face of this earth and should never take that for granted . xxoo Met you at the bar , I only stayed for a quick beer.. You are from PA and here on business . I wanted to buy you a drink but I was in a hurry . Maybe we can meet up for a drink when you 're back in the area ?

You were at the cash machine on Thursday morning around 8:30 AM . You had your hair colored red . Something about your simplicity and your naturalness really got me staring at you , was shy to approach you as I thought you might not be interested in a 40 year old guy . If you see this , hope you respond back . Love your personality and overall rad vibe. I 'd love to get to know you better. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. I 've seen you a couple times and I 'm amazed by you tall gorgeous smile . I think you noticed me checking you out.Never posted on here but I 'm shy and a bit intimidated . Doubt you 'll see this but if you do please say hi . You are and older yet fit white man . You are always wearing black or gray sleeveless shirts and shorts . We always make eye contact when you are on a stationary bike in the front . You are on there all the time before you work out and post workout . I overheard someone call you and your name is john . Super sexy man . I also saw you driving off in a BMW . We locked eyes and smiled to each other on BART . You even looked back when you got off at Montgomery Street . I tried to find you but got lost in the shuffle . I walked around the block and even went to Starbucks , just for a chance to say hi. Me : Young guy in a yellow/gray hoodie. You : Beautiful brunette in a slim-fitting dress with black leggings and red lipstick. I felt something this morning . If you did too , please respond . This is uncharacteristic but ca n't get you out of my head so figured I give this a shot. It was last Saturday . I stopped into Rite Aid . You were working the register closest to the door. A beautiful brunette with glasses . You said hello , I said it back . I grabbed what I needed and stood in line . We made eye contact a few times while waiting . Maybe you thought I was suspicious , maybe something else . I ended up at the other register . We made eye contact again . On my way out I said goodbye and you responded back. I 'm not sure what your situation is but I ca n't shake you. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile . Please message me back if there is something real or it was all in my head J Mathilda says hi . Too bad you 've been banned my friend . I just hope you did n't get wasted on coconut water to compensate ... Wow you are super cute ! I could n't stop staring at you as you walked through the cross . I gave a smile you gave one back and then , , , I noticed your bum and you looked back and caught me , guess i was n't to discrete . I hope I did n't creep you out , sorry , but you are adorable . I hope you see this and know I 'm gon na be day dreaming about you and your amazing body , probably for the rest of the week. Thanks for walking in front of my truck ! Sorry for the misunderstanding . I have good intentions ... just asking for peace nothing more . Hope I did n't offend you . Have a nice day . : - ) This post was a fine post , in addition I think it should be added that often enough a relationship can become so strained that one or both parties decide that the relationship is beyond an ability to reconcile . We 're all grown ups though , we all know that . While I believe in mutual understanding , understandably it 's a well that can go dry . Like anything if you do n't take care of the things you have , you ca n't expect to keep it . Honesty is probably a key factor . Responsibility for ones actions another in reconciliation. I like this topic I see you all the time , and love your smiles and your sexy outfits.Always look forward to seeing you cross paths with me.If your interest is piqued , respond to this and I will share some more details . Mostly old white dudes here but I 've spotted a few hotties recently . I 'm a swimmer and usually hit the pool when I 'm there . Anyone looking for a workout partner ? You : Doe , stacks , white , ultra cool and easygoing . Blatino PS . We talked about Dwinelle and other things while people were heading to the sling area to fuck . My ride was leaving and I had to leave the desert . We never exchanged # s. Are you as curious as I am ? Let me know what dept you work in and a little about me ... and if you want to continue . i see you there when i work out in early afternoon . brown hair , nice , nice infrastructure ; i would n't be surprised if maybe you were south american with euro thrown in. me , s/p bearded , fit , lean guy with blue orbs You seemed to be an attendant to a nice older lady in a wheelchair . While we were waiting in the radiology area , you kept stretching and yawning and saying `` Good Night , at 1100am . You are very attractive , in my eyes , and I would like to spend some time with you . I was wearing glasses and a short , trimmed beard and sitting a few seats behind you and to your left . Hi Sam , Hopefully this gets to her or someone she knows . I am a classmate of yours and I wanted to let you know I do have a print for you. I had to leave in rush because a friend who is in town and staying with me was at my front door and had to run back home. I realized I didnt give you my info so that once I made another print I could give it to you . Sorry I found a print that I did make and its yours for free Just contact me and its yours. take care : ) Hello , You were dancing to your music in your van this morning on the 101 freeway headed north . We flirted back and forth , and I loved your shy smile . I blew you a kiss and you caught it : ) I wish I could have said hello , but being on the freeway made that pretty impossible . I know this is a long shot , but was the best option i can think of to try to find you . If by chance you see this , I 'd love to hear from you . If you do write , please tell me what I was driving so I know it you . Here 's hoping ! D My presence exists only with you. Can you feel it now ? Could you feel me coming ? Did you retreat somewhere safer ? I would n't blame you . It 's terrifying here . I do n't know what 's more terrifying ... Be it the unfathomable extent to which life has changed ? Or the painfully beautiful memories I never even considered I could miss proving me wrong . A lifetime of memories ; compressed into a few distinct feelings : all equallyIntense , abrasive , soul piercing as one another . Ca n't shift my focus ... You overflow my mind , It 's splitting at the seams ; terrified of what it dreams The rain continues to fall Nostalgia prevails over all Will you notice me or look away ? Are you even there ? It 's time I take that breath and a plunger Hi , I met this wonderful lady on c-space ( a website ) but she has not logged in since our last conversation on 5/9 . She is 23 years old and 5'2 . She was born in Vietnam and came here 5 years ago . If this is you please log back in or , if you forgot your password , reply to this post . I really want to continue talking with you . Have a nice day ! : ) I met you in Berkley in the summer of 1973 . Your father was an Air Force pilot and you have connections to the Pacific Northwest . Please contact me , Joe You were the tall brunette with near perfect body that farted in the bread last night . I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked `` Was that you ? You quickly replied `` No it was n't me ! As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence , but it was evident . I tried to get rid of the stench by waving two loaves of Ciabetta bread . You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner . You 're beautiful and even if you were a liar and fart like a Clydesdale I 'd love to meet up . Friends recognize each others limits and value each other enough to not continuing to cross those metaphorical lines . Friends value each other 's truth and respect each other enough to at least not lie . Nothing is one sided , odds are in favor of both sides having a role in the play . But there is a scale of acceptable behavior . There does exist something that 's referred to as fair play . I tried to have patience and I was very forgiving . Even willing to take you back for a twice broken trust . You put me through hell . Should n't have wasted our time killing each other. I 'm all out of fight. Go and fuck with some other persons head . But make sure he 's stupid . Perhaps you think I have nothing better to do than write poems you are n't going to read ? Humph , and double-humph .

The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands .

You forgot your detergent and had to go back home around 6:45 . I was standing on the corner , waiting for my friend to arrive for dinner , when you walked by . He and I parted ways in the median around 8 and you passed by us -- back to the laundromat , earbuds in your ears , glasses on your nose , flip-flops on your feet -- walking in rhythm the whole time . You got on the F train this morning at about 8:30 AM with an older white gentleman . You had a star of David necklace on , a striped black and white shirt with some fitted jeans .

We made a comment or two , tell me about what . But I want to meet if you are out there reading . Why are you doing this ? Is it entertaining for you ? Do you feel it 's somehow deserved ? Because she 's hot , a goddess , then she deserves to be objectified and written off of a person lacking in substance , unworthy of respect , of love ?

We were waiting for our orders and chatted a little. You were wearing a maroon sweater , black leggings and light brown Uggs .

You looked friendly , I would n't mind having a longer conversation : - ) Love , R. He moves his hips to the side a little bit and allows her knees room for leverage . She pulls her t-shirt up and over her head . Catching her hair , it falls behind her as she reaches to unhook her bra . The candlelight plays in images across her round breasts and flaccid nipples . She leans forward , placing one nipple to his wet lips as she pulls her pants off . First with one arm , then the other , she works the fabric down from her ankles until she is lying completely atop of him in nothing but cotton panties . He loves her creamy white skin and blinks hard to catch glimpses of her curves in the dim lighting . We met up at a study today , i thought you were pretty cute , you were awfully talkative and always seemed to have something to say . I would like to hang out , just chill and shit . You seem like you 'd make a cool friend Hey , Last night ( Tuesday , 5/26 ) , in the evening , we both were in the back-room on a mini platform watching the other guys going at it . Then , two guys came up to us , blew us and all eyes were on us . I noticed that you were the same guy when we both checked in at the same time ( I was behind you waiting for my turn to check in ) .

You did n't want complications so it 's ironic you are catering to her wanting a baby . It will get old .

Are you still out there playing ? I did not think it would be this hard to have no contact with you. Please let me know how things are going for you . I hope you are happy. Still love you. Your Lobster Exchanged some looks and smiles in Pegasus on Memorial Day ... .should have talked to you ? I was making fun of my friend and we all smiled . Well , email might work better . This could be for anyone . Or do you mean for the billion or so readers that we are all too late ? Not sure if you decided not to chat more , or if the temporary Craigslist email addresses expired. Either Way , could you get a hold of me so I know ? Dennis I asked how mans sets you had left . You are very sexy and I 'd like to get together . If you see this and are interested , let me know what machine and how many set you had . The happiest place on earth was inside your heart and especially inside your mouth , vagina and anus - you hot Pinay . I should have married you . You are a voluptuous white woman wearing jeans and red tshirt that said `` Application ? Driving a gray color mini truck. Me white man pumping gas at booth island. You are probably taken , but if not where do I fill out that application ? I got it bad for you . I should have approached you but I saw movement in the front seat so I held my ground . When you drove away , there was a nice looking brindle pit with you . I Wish I would have known . We 'd probably be talking right now . It 's been awhile and I lost your contact info . I would love to see you again . You work in Napa area and I work in Sebastopol area . If this is you , name the PARK we met at . It is a challenge to connect with a stranger during a crowded BART commute . This morning I wanted to say hi to you . I tried to do it with my eyes , but that was n't quite enough. You have a nice open face . You got off at Montgomery at about 9:20 . Black pants , black boots to your knee , black blazer , black and white stripped shirt . What was distinctive ? The stud earring in your upper left ear . I was wearing a green shirt with a tie . We both are married and good friends ( you are good friend of my wife ) . We both know that we want each other but could n't say it openly ( though you mentioned in a party on the weekend that you have hearts for me ... you were drunk ) . You are petite and I am tall Indian guy . We both think a like and very practical . I badly want you ... you have no idea how many times I fantasized about you . Will you we able to keep it a secret and enjoy ? Hope you see this and reply back . I am N and you are M. We passed each other outside the doors at Palace Art & amp ; Supply in Capitola on Monday afternoon . You were super cute , black hair , nose ring , jeans , etc , and scowling , I was scowling too . Mine was for my current project sapping the life force out of me , which is why I fumbled until you had passed . Maybe yours was for a similar art project or at the bright sun , or at me . Maybe we can inspire each other . Maybe we can go get supplies at the same time next week ? Moving his hand from her face , he caresses her long hair . Taking the lightest dark locks in between his fingers , he twirls these parts of her fast until they pull taut and fall back to her shoulders . He enjoys this game , pulling her to him in these small bits until , slightly tortured , she falls back to her own side . He touches her soft cheek , hoping that touch will suffice for words until he has time to think things through . She smiles , happily accepting the affectionate gesture from her new lover . The brightness in her eyes takes him almost by surprise . She never seems to smile anymore . `` Dammit , he tells himself , `` Kiss her , hug her or something . . . . Either response would be too simple to explain the complexity of emotions he feels for her . She yields to his desire , turning her head to the other side and exposing her untouched skin . Deliberately , he runs the flat of his wet tongue over the salt of her neck . He does n't bite yet , but moves over her until she lies flat on top of the lumped up bed covers . From this pinned position , she comes alive . Moving only her hands , she manages to pull his t-shirt out of his belt and half way up over his back . She runs her tiny hands over the warmed , exposed skin and kisses him with a passion incomparable to that of his deviant biting . Her strong thighs wrap around his waist , pulling him to her in one swift surge . Whatever her doubts and insecurities were , she finds no solace in her concerns . Rather , she rolls over with him until she is in a half sitting position on top of his clothed body . Ravenously , she kisses him with vengeance until the saliva from within her cheeks drips easily from his slick lips . To the super cute woman I bumped into twice at two places in 10 mins , I was thoroughly charmed and I am now painfully bewitched ... Wanted to ask you to lunch but was too late in the parking lot ... . Write to me , you cutie : ) This seldom happens to me , but man it did today ! You rang me up this afternoon at ACE Hardware in Sebastopol . I saw a quick glimpse of your eyes during a typical friendly exchange at first , and could n't believe what I saw. No ... ..could n't be ... ... . But it so was true ! The biggest hazel deep green , sparkly , fantastically incredible gorgeous eyes I 've even seen ! We looked at each other as I gave you some cash , I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the money thing . Then you gave me change , I think I may have said have a great afternoon , but I locked onto , and into those perfectly clear pools of hypnotic green for what seemed like minutes ! And heres the part that seldom happens to me , they stayed with me all day and into the evening ! Like I had just left you moments ago ! I could so look at those eyes again ! Thank you ! Crossed paths at the Mexican market there Miller Ave. on Monday I think . I was next in line behind you . Would like to sit and have coffee with you , my treat .

I thought you were really attractive , but I did n't get your number . If you see this , let me know the details of our bet ! Long shot , but we played for a few minutes at the Jacks party last night . We were both in the lobby afterwards . As you were leaving , I think you said `` Thanks for letting me join .

She holds his hand by the tips of his fingers and enjoys feeling the familiar bend in his hand as he lights candles with his other hand . Fumbling , he places the candle atop the desk and moves her to his bed. She sits , patiently attentive to her thoughts , on top of the jumbled bed clothes and watches him take off his shoes with delicate balance . Holding her face , he kisses her on both cheeks before removing her glasses and placing them on the nightstand . The kisses feel good to her and she enjoys the warm breath on her goospimpled skin . Again , he kisses her softly on the face as he moves his stubbled framed mouth to her smooth lips . She pulls back slightly , startled at the roughness of his three day beard , but resumes relaxation as his kisses move from her mouth to her neck . I asked you for a light you told me the night before you drank way too much I told you how to cure that. Your BF is a bartender. I saw you glancing after we talked outside. I was looking too. I 'll have to have more dreams about `` what if ... How do i ask u to ? How do I suppress my selfish need to explore other sexual experiences while wanting u all to myself . I want to make out and cuddle with her then come home and fall deeper in love with u. I need a reboot once in a while from a real throbbing penis , but have no desire to commit to a man . We have been through so much and when my dying day comes I wanthyou holding my hand , raising our children . I 'm asking u to be stronger than me , I 'm askingbyou to let me wander while you stay faithful to me ! She gently tosses her head to one side and the dim light catches under her eyes in what almost seems to be a leery , ominous glow of intensity . He ca n't tell if she is still smiling because her face is tilted slightly to one side , but he can hear her unsure , off rhythm breath clearly . `` Come on he says , gently pulling her up from her knees . He knows he 's taking a chance with her since he 's not quite sure where they stand , but the moment is too much for him to ignore . She stands slowly , not quite sure what she thinks of the situation -- of him -- but follows him into the bedroom . and wonder is he looking at at it too ? Will he return your text if you contacted him ? What would he say if you showed up at his door ? You miss at how his hugs and caresses melted your problems away even if it was for a few days. You miss at how his flirting , laughter made you smile , laugh and brought you joy. You miss at how he magically would make the darkness disappear for a while. You miss at how his passionate kisses would make your toes curl. Then you realize , the reason he is not there still exists. He wanted more than you were willing to give. He was unwilling to accept less than he wanted. He was tired of being pushed away every time you felt the need to run away. He was tired of being the one you called only when you felt abandoned by others. You do not miss that he easily brought you sadness when he pushed back as you push him away. Sometimes events , people remind him of you like someone did last night . Sometimes events , people remind you of him . Sometimes you just want to snuggle up to him one last time , see if the fire and passion are in his kisses ... Looking for another sister CD to live with in santa rosa as a roommate.

SEND e-mail with pic so we can start this. Room is ready 6-1-15. You were by yourself , leaving as I was going in . You definitely looked at me and smiled , I thought you were very pretty and would like to say `` Hi and get to know you . I am older . I did n't mean to be rude by walking by without saying anything . You looked nervous , really pretty but nervous . I wanted to say something but I get it . Well I do n't understand any of it but I 'm not trying to come at you if you do n't want me to . I still hope you would hit me up . Hey today I walked in and ordered a drink . You were the cute cashier . With curly brownish hair and a cute smile . I thought you were hot . starbucks on capitol expressway and McLaughlin . were both the same age it was around 11.20 . You were a cute , fun loving woman dancing samba by the water ; ) . You can shake ! Was torn between watching your sensual moves or your radiant smile when you danced . You were there with friends . We smiled , we talked after the event . I wanted to dance with you later that night but you had someone. We share a mutual acquaintance , used to live in the same city , enjoyed a witty quick conversation that ended too soon. Long shot , but hey better than not trying . Christine , I 've thought about you a lot over the years and I think we really could have made a great couple . Do you believe in second chances ? We could be great together . -T Last saw you a couple of weeks ago . We were supposed to hang out again . Where did you disappear to ? You seemed like a great gal who loves the outdoors , we talked for a minute and then continued on . I think we met on Rough Go . Woe to me for not saying more ! But now I am asking , would you like to meet again , for a hike , or a drink , or both ? : ) You introduced yourself as Crystal and partnered with me at the ballroom dance lessons , and you showed me how to Waltz . I was n't planning to go to the Ball but I went in hopes of seeing you again . We danced even though I did n't know how to dance , and I told you that I was really only there so I would have a chance to dance with you again . I realized afterwards that was a mistake because of how awkward it made things . I 'm sorry I made you so uncomfortable . I hope you still had a great rest of the night , and that you find someone who treats you right because I think you are very special . Hi Corey. You were at the Cafe with friends . I was looking at the apartment ads when you were out having a cigarette . this was about 830pm . Should have given you my phone number then . Lets meet up ! Just tell me where you live , so I know it is you . I exist now dreaming in reality , shades of deep reds and grays , Evolving at the speed of light As my third eye sees all , I bring my fingers to my lips and time stops I taste you. I ponder you and wallow in the memory of your scent and way. How you called me baby The way you made me laugh The way you touched my heart and made me believe Unable to stop , it seems too wonderful , but in the end there is not much but pain. I allow this for some time , then I awake and know that I am alive and the possibilities are endless. Wanting you to taste my soul and undeniably know that I am the one and we are one to conquer happiness together , unimaginably , the way you knew that we could and will if you say one word , Yes ! Your fear . Your ego . Your pride . They protect and also hurt you , keeping you from what is rightfully yours , Love. If I had your heart again ? Oh , the way I would touch it , nurture it and protect it My most sacred gift God wants what I want , he trusts me and knows my light is pure as he does you. Say the word once. The heavens will open up and the angels will sing in our praise Because we chose. Please do n't be afraid , I am always here for you. I 'LL MISS YOU IM LEAVING THE U.S .

I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE TO MEET A PERSON AND START A FRIENDSHIP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GOES FROM THERE . Saw you on the bench reading and picking your nose . I walked by several times to get your attention but you seemed preoccupied with the nose thing . I had on grey shorts and tennies . Tell me where the bench was to make sure it 's you . I left work because you freed me from it . I had it all along - you ! My knowledge -- & gt ; wisdom -- & gt ; success w/o you ? = uncertainty You : I love you. Me : I love you more.

You are so beautiful Hispanic woman with black or brown curly hair and a lovely smile I was breathtaking . I did n't have time to say something and I did n't want to get you in to trouble . But I enjoyed locking eyes and smile with you . If you see this I would like to get together and go for coffee or Ice cream together or something . I miss the way you closed your eyes when I kissed you. I wish I could kiss you again . Wow , I did n't think anything about meeting someone at the drive thru , then I got to the window , we shared a little bit , and then I left . I have n't stopped thinking about you , I think we had a connection . I you feel the same message me back , put the name of the restaurant in the subject line , hope to hear from you soon . As I was leaving the farmers market , you were getting out of your car and then getting stuff out of the passenger 's side . You were wearing these navy yoga pants , and you were arcing your back and bending your hips in just such a way ... well , I could n't not stare . And I know you caught me staring ( off the reflection on your car ) . So - first , sorry for staring . Second , if it 's not weird to say , thank you . Your butt was the highlight of my day . Absolutely incredible ; ) If you write , tell me what color and make your car is. I posted here in a time of weakness and pain . You used it as an opportunity to judge me and browbeat me with your evangelical Christian brainwashing . You judged me as being in pain because I needed Jesus . You are dangerously misinformed about your own outer religion . when I responded to thank you but point out Mathhew 6:5 - do n't be like the hypocrites - and the Book of Job - bad things happen to great people and you should n't judge - you flew into a rage . This has happened three other times that I 've posted here . I did not ask for help or to be evangelized . I was merely telling my story . You use Jesus to aggrandize your own ego . I 'm literally thinking every day of killing myself and you are out there trying to make me feel even worse about myself through your idea of religion . You get a good feeling out of telling other people you are holier than they are when they are down . You are just awful . I should be free FROM your religion . Hey We chatted at the bar , your name was Hannah and you said you teach in San Mateo . I wish I had asked you out , but you left ... .. You were going to see Dior and I , I was in the lobby waiting for friends . We smiled and said hello . Would love to meet you . We could not keep our eyes from eachother ... You in your black leather jacket and kids , me in black shirt and jeans . I tried to figure out a way to come introduce myself but you seemed to be with your family ! You 'll never see this I 'm sure but just for fun You were in the yellow muscle shirt . I was staring and admiring your beautiful , large hard pecs . You smiled big at me , and I got embarrassed . I 'm working on that -- should have said hi . Hi ? We met on the beach with our dogs . I told you I loved red hair . When you told me you were a high school teacher I told you the boys must be hot for you . You said you were stressed from finals . I can help . We can go to nude beach and be totally free and relaxed then my place where I have massage table for a sensual full body massage then I would give you totally oral bliss . And that just the beginning BABY , I AM SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW I TREATED YOU.LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS NO GOOD , YOUR MY SUNSHINE , MY BABY GIRL .I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AND START NEW ! I COULD TYPE FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT I WISH OR WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD RATHER BE LOOKING INTO YOUR SEXY BROWN EYES AND TELLING YOU INPERSON ... .THIS SUCKS BABY : I NEED YOU , WANT YOU , MISS YOU !

Ps ... ... i love you baby ! Leoncio Navarro i really want to see you . If your attached or not . Please find me . T I have moments in my day when I think about us . I do n't cry anymore , sigh at times and maybe clear my throat , but it 's not at all like the first time . I have realized that the greatest gift you gave me was the lesson in loving myself and realizing my worth . It may have come at a cost , because in that very process I learned that our failures were not worth carrying around but rather to be placed under my feet and used as stepping stones to something better. I ca n't begin to tell you how many times I have ended something with someone simply because your voice echoes in my head `` you are better than that , you deserve more I always credit you for my change of behavior and even though it makes me want to scream at times , I am most pleased with the outcome : - ) your love paved the way to a healthier me and I needed you to know that it was not all for nothing ! In some attempts , it is glorious even to fail I saw you in Carls Jr in Martinez SATURDAY about 6 or 7pm . You were with another girl & amp ; some young dude . You had pushed a baby stroller to your table . When I first saw you , I was so hooked . I could n't take my eyes off you . I left a note for you to find , I pray . Then when I drove away , past the window where you were sitting , ... you and the other chick were totally staring at me , & amp ; both of you were waving at me . YOU MADE MY YEAR , ..THANK YOU SO MUCH ! ! I 'M THE `` BEAVER PLEASER & amp ; I 'd love 2 lick your sweet Beaver again and again and again and again just to see your BEAUTIFUL SMILE .

CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME ! So , you were at 90 's night tonight and you were by far the coolest human there . Your moves were solid across the board , and you were clearly there for the music , not to hook up , which is why I Ieft you way the hell alone ( also : social anxiety ) . BUT ( and this is a big but ) , it maybe seemed like you could be could be interested , or maybe I am totally off base . You were present , but , like , never actively pursuing , so it 's hard to tell . Anyway , um , you had light jeans on and a tight black top that really highlighted your quite exquisite back . I was just , you know , a white human , black shirt , basically the most boring thing ever . But I promise I am at least a little cool , if you did want to reach out . K. Good night . Too weak and tired to write much tonight ; why is my muse not bringing me coffee and rolling me with a rolling pin ? It 's in the job description . Anyhow , this is the best I can do tonight , despite all the beautiful women in the world ... : -/ The nIght of the hot red things I 've seen big cafeterias And vaulted marble ceilings , I 've seen dark things mysterious And people with no feelings I 've seen bright fields of roses And golden onion domes , I 've seen misshapen noses , And brand new mobile homes I 've seen two tits to die for , And Martin Luther King , I 've seen San Bernardino , And damn near everything ! But something that I 'm missing Which it seems I need to see , Is a year or two of kissing you , In the third degree ! Three More Bloody Haikuses Not infrequently I feel like I will die Love is a life boat Thinking of your face At times when you look happy Helps me to survive Following one 's heart Leads one through flaming canyons And down to the beach If I need you more than I want you ...

Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance tonight , Saturday , May 23 , Wischelman Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect . I 'm looking for a cute , sweet and drop-dead gorgeous girl whose name is Dulce who was a manager at a Carl 's Jrs at 1999 Camden Ave ( San Jose , CA ) with Marylou . Dulce speaks Spanish as well. I do n't want to flirt nor date . I just want to say hi and know how is she doing. Hi , Dulce . You worked at Carls Jrs ( Union and Camden ) I ate there almost every weekend since November 2012 till December 2013. Dulce , you probably remember me . You sighed virtually every time you saw me . How are you ? You were upstairs having a drink with your friends sitting on a stool overlooking the drunk dancers . You wore glasses and a white top and I could just tell you had a good vibe to you . Would love to get to know you better . You came in looking for a restroom..Then came back with a smile to update me..I wish we had just a minute longer I 'm wondering if you saw me ? I thought maybe you were looking into my eyes , because I Was looking into yours . I was inside and you were walking by with a friend . I looked thru the window and between the fence , you were wearing black fitness pants with a yellowish top and a Scarlett scarf/headband . If you saw me ? Let me know . Never thought I 'd see my girl til I saw you tonight . You were at the corner of 23rd and Castro making a left , listening to Pac and smoking a cigarette . You stopped me in my tracks and I could n't look away . I was walking up 23rd backwards looking at you take a drag off that smoke while you made the left . Silver Hyundai . How many girls listen to Pac rolling around by themselves ? If you saw me let me know and tell me what I was wearing . If you see this and you do n't wan na reach out I just got ta say keep doin you , it looks like it 's working . You know no one does it it like you . When I was sad , I let myself be sad . Well I guess it 's time to be happy . You fill my dreams and nightmares . Let me taste you , my longing for you as I grip my knees on either side of you . Let me make it up to you . I wish the best for you . I was really good to you . I just love your secret smile . I do n't think I 'll post here again . I 'm in a place of peace and hope . I am even more puzzled , than hurt . It 's a real shame too . It 's just something I 'd do for you . Hear me moan as you take a fist of my hair in one hand my flesh in the other . Have a nice life . Have a great weekend ! Be kind to me . As I said , there is someone waiting for me out there . All the love I felt but could n't express . All pain and nothing about it . Accept it and cherish it . Sat for an hour and a half trying to work up to go in and ask you out . I do n't think you 've realized it but every single time ive walked into your jobs , this and the one before and unless im mistaken theres one that was before that but I just liked to go and kinda check you out , its been with the intent to ask you out on a date . I really suck at it . I see you almost daily at World Gym and we exchange smiles every now and then . I wish I can say more or be any more descriptive , but if I did I 'll reveal who you are . If you think it is you that I am talking about , send me an email with what you were wearing at the gym today . Hi Cutie , You were sitting next to me at a stop light and you reached back to roll the window down so your son could say hi to me. HMU -- let 's chat . We had some hot fun a month or two again and I 'd love to feed you my cock again . I loved your submissive and how you too my thick cock Respond back with what we did and how you look so I know its you Hope to hear from you ; I donthave grindr anymore so lost contact I hope , I hope you see this . I was sitting at the window counter sipping an iced tea and reading . You were in line and then you sat next to me while you waited for your drink . I could n't think of anything to say but what I wanted to say was . `` hi , I love you hair Cute boots. You look to be about 50-55 grey hair , stocky build ... .you were wearing nice blue plaid type shirt and had your face buried in the paper . We exchanged glances a few times I thought you were very nice looking , any way if you are into guys and remember my greeting , say hello and see where this nice bottom guy can take you ... . If the stars align perhaps we can meet again ... ... . Damn this short attention span I was perfectly content on my island , but you came in like a monsoon , sucking me out to sea . Floating in the warmth of your intentions . The calm winds began to change , sputtering gusts at first . Tropical blasts battered followed by arctic chills sending me so off course there was no hope of finding my way back . Now I 'm left adrift , watching the compass spin , knowing that the next rush will be the final blow that drowns me . Please just put me back where you found me . Good looking tall black guy wearing scrubs and a jacket . Made eye contact several times . Discreet professional white guy here standing across from you . Would love to connect if you see this . Let me know what was on your jacket so I know it 's you . I know I probably enjoyed that just as much , if not more than you . i wanted to add a few sweet little kisses in here and there on your neck and shoulder area but it would have been a little bit improper.i hope you take me up on my offer , a little bit of privacy and better setting will make a world 's difference . i promise to remain a complete gentleman the entire time and respect any limitations you may have.just keep in mind im willing to go the extra mile ... ... .

Each day I get on BART , I see you when you get on at Orinda before we head into the tunnel towards SF , you stand right by the door , heading I know not where , I 'd like to be able to say something to you , even a hi , but I 'm too shy to . I 'm the one with the bike and the bike clothes , sitting there in the seat wishing I could just say something , but then Embarcadero comes and I have to get off because I 'm going to work , flying around the city , delivering goods . I would love to actually get to talk to you , but this biker is very shy . I do n't know if you 'll be there the next time I ride and each time I can only hope . Please be that Hope . you just got to your parked car and I was walking by.. you put your backpack in the trunk , put money in the meter and then passed me.. when you walked towards me you said `` helllo.. or how are you I said hello back . I watched you walk down the street . man.. you are so handsome . In the unlikely event that you see this.. email me so we can meet for coffee sometime . Hello there , you like being outdoors and hiking on trails and need a new friend to talk to , I am a working guy who would like to meet another easygoing person to get to know better and have some hiking fun on the weekends . I am looking for relationship and love ... . You Latin looking bear with that hot beard hanging around at closing . Me stocky masculine bearded white linebacker who wanted to seriously put your legs over my shoulders and make you beg . This is a long shot but if you are out there reading this and interested HMU. Tell me what it is about your beard that is different so I know it 's you . 24 Hour Fitness , SuperSport on Crane To the cute girl with glasses jogging around between sets , I 'm glad you took an extra lap by me as I was finishing up .

If this is you , and you 're interested , please reply and tell me what my vehicle was so I know it was you . I just wanted to say thank you for your compassion . My girlfriend and I were there with our dog who we ended up having to let go . From the exam room I heard the tech apologizing for the wait and could hear you saying it was no problem , that you understood ... I would like to think that most people in your shoes would feel the same way , but working in a veterinary hospital myself , I know that people can be amazingly insensitive and selfish when made to wait under similar circumstances . So thank you so much for your kindness , patience , and compassion . I hope your dog is okay , he was really cute and under any other circumstances I would have given him all the attention he seemed to want from us ! Take care , and please know that your small kindness made a big difference to us on that very painful night . As I came out of Trader Joes you were there with your children and you looked at me like you knew me and you said Hi and you took my breath you were so beautiful . I am pretty sure I said Hi back but I walked straight to my car . OMG you were so beautiful and I ca n't shake that feeling that you must know me . as God is my witness , love will prevail . I have you in my sights , and , to quote our nasal friend Mr. Declan P. MacManus , `` My aim is true ! `` C. x S. I had suitcases , you had ( blank ) . Very sexy eyes , gave me great thoughts through the day ... . You- Beauty in a light blue suv. Me- Red shirt , white truck. I should n't have gotten off at my exit ... You had no makeup on , white shirt with black yoga pants . You have a beautiful face . I was by you on bart with a grey sweatshirt . Lets talk ... .email me and tell me its you by saying what oakland stop you got off at ... . I know this is a long shot but you were wearing a north face coat earlier this week . I saw you by bart , you had glasses on . This is to just say hi and maybe become friends , nothing else , you look like you have a lot on your mind and could use a person to talk to . I dont have any ill intentions just friends . I am a man and would respect any situation your in . I saw this couple near Mission/15th and the male was being very aggressive and looked like he was about to be abusive . I 'd really like to know whether this was a school experiment to see what passersby would say . It freaked me out and I 'd like to ease my mind . ( I did yell at him that I 'd taken his picture so he better not hurt her but I had kids in the car so I felt I could n't do more . ) You look fancy in that somewhat short green skirt . You got good legs and an attractive look and physique . I got into pumping gas seeing you were pumping gas in the pump near De Anza Park : ) Seems you noticed I looked at you - may be not , could not be sure. You are pretty. I 've seen you while riding my bike down Shattuck while you wait for the 18 . I have seen you a few times on the 18 towards Albany/Solano , also . You usually get on somewhere around Alcatraz , I think , sometimes on Ashby. We 've smiled at each other pleasantly , though I 've always wanted to strike up a conversation with you , despite you wearing headphones ( and I recognize that 's maybe the point of wearing them and I do not fault you for wanting to be left alone on public transit ) . I 'm a tall , bearded , glasses-wearing goober who is often reading or slipping back and forth between awake and asleep thanks to the early hour and the warm bus ride . I think we 'd get along , though I ca n't really say why. Would you be interested in getting a pint or a tumbler or a cuppa something sometime ? I would relish the opportunity to get to know you better . Hi , Beautiful girl who was sitting next to me on IHSS Orientation at 1 pm today . You left your SS card in the car . Please get back to me if you read this. Greg Easily the prettiest/hottest/sexiest woman I think I have ever seen ! Seriously . Super model style . Anyone else notice how perfect that woman was ? Grey denim . Bun . Painted toes . Trying my best to be respectful. Anyways , made my day as I stood in that shitty line . So big thanks , to the brunette who , I 'm assuming is a model . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . * I do n't take much shit from ladies , *even the sexy/hot girls . EVER . I would let this woman walk all over me like a loser . Actually I would n't . But some dude is a lucky S.O.B. This is whats up to that cute ass asian working out at the Fremont 24 by Bart around the noon time . Just saying whats up tho . I have n't seen you in so long . I 've made too many mistakes to make it right . I hope you 're doing well . I love you ... forever I 'm lost for words . Yes , me . I know it took a lot for you to do that . Thank you but just know that I 'm trying to make `` sense of it . Even though I do n't think `` sense has anything to do with this ( smile ) . I will admit , you scare me a little bit , but in a good way . Please be patient with me , I do n't know what to do and that is the truth. I was the gent that waved to you and thought that you were so wonderful ! I am hoping if you are single that you would go out with me for a coffee date ? If interested let me know ok ... ... . sincerely me ... . You get me off the equipment I was using so you could complete your routine I would love to get to know you better and i wish you end up reading this Tell me which equipment I was using I 'm looking to find and reconnect with you , we met and went on a couple dates . You were really nice and pretty . Curvy , had a nose ring , pretty short hair from what I remember and tattoos . Things ended but I wish they did n't . Please reply . You 've recently worked with my family putting in a sport court . I 'm not really the type to post something like this but you 've been on my mind ever since you came by to show us your tiles . I 've heard through the grapevine that your a divorced dad of one . Is there any chance you 'd be interested in a divorced mom of one ? I 'm secure , sane , and your sense of humor is right up my ally . I hope I hear back . I 'm mixed black and white , short hair , glasses and beard You said your name was _hil , ''like Phil , but with a _ . and that you were headed to Temescal to meet with some friends.

Thanks for letting me know I almost forgot my plant ! Coffee sometime ? ... that after three grueling years I may have finally turned the corner health-wise . A misread MRI and a therapist who knows the correct course of treatment give me hope where there was none . So this is a good chance to thank you for the support you have given me in your own special way . It 's been nothing short of astonishing ... I literally do n't know how I would have survived without you . I truly do n't know where your heart lies , I think you can feel my confusion when I go off on one of my jackass rifts ... if it 's with someone else , that makes your support of me even more amazing . You are an angel , one sent here to help me through my darkest hour and if I can ever do anything for you all you need do is pick up the phone . Whoever you love is the luckiest person on the face of this earth and should never take that for granted . xxoo Met you at the bar , I only stayed for a quick beer.. You are from PA and here on business . I wanted to buy you a drink but I was in a hurry . Maybe we can meet up for a drink when you 're back in the area ?

You were at the cash machine on Thursday morning around 8:30 AM . You had your hair colored red . Something about your simplicity and your naturalness really got me staring at you , was shy to approach you as I thought you might not be interested in a 40 year old guy . If you see this , hope you respond back . Love your personality and overall rad vibe. I 'd love to get to know you better. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. I 've seen you a couple times and I 'm amazed by you tall gorgeous smile . I think you noticed me checking you out.Never posted on here but I 'm shy and a bit intimidated . Doubt you 'll see this but if you do please say hi . You are and older yet fit white man . You are always wearing black or gray sleeveless shirts and shorts . We always make eye contact when you are on a stationary bike in the front . You are on there all the time before you work out and post workout . I overheard someone call you and your name is john . Super sexy man . I also saw you driving off in a BMW . We locked eyes and smiled to each other on BART . You even looked back when you got off at Montgomery Street . I tried to find you but got lost in the shuffle . I walked around the block and even went to Starbucks , just for a chance to say hi. Me : Young guy in a yellow/gray hoodie. You : Beautiful brunette in a slim-fitting dress with black leggings and red lipstick. I felt something this morning . If you did too , please respond . This is uncharacteristic but ca n't get you out of my head so figured I give this a shot. It was last Saturday . I stopped into Rite Aid . You were working the register closest to the door. A beautiful brunette with glasses . You said hello , I said it back . I grabbed what I needed and stood in line . We made eye contact a few times while waiting . Maybe you thought I was suspicious , maybe something else . I ended up at the other register . We made eye contact again . On my way out I said goodbye and you responded back. I 'm not sure what your situation is but I ca n't shake you. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile . Please message me back if there is something real or it was all in my head J Mathilda says hi . Too bad you 've been banned my friend . I just hope you did n't get wasted on coconut water to compensate ... Wow you are super cute ! I could n't stop staring at you as you walked through the cross . I gave a smile you gave one back and then , , , I noticed your bum and you looked back and caught me , guess i was n't to discrete . I hope I did n't creep you out , sorry , but you are adorable . I hope you see this and know I 'm gon na be day dreaming about you and your amazing body , probably for the rest of the week. Thanks for walking in front of my truck ! Sorry for the misunderstanding . I have good intentions ... just asking for peace nothing more . Hope I did n't offend you . Have a nice day . : - ) This post was a fine post , in addition I think it should be added that often enough a relationship can become so strained that one or both parties decide that the relationship is beyond an ability to reconcile . We 're all grown ups though , we all know that . While I believe in mutual understanding , understandably it 's a well that can go dry . Like anything if you do n't take care of the things you have , you ca n't expect to keep it . Honesty is probably a key factor . Responsibility for ones actions another in reconciliation. I like this topic I see you all the time , and love your smiles and your sexy outfits.Always look forward to seeing you cross paths with me.If your interest is piqued , respond to this and I will share some more details .

Hi Sam , Hopefully this gets to her or someone she knows . I am a classmate of yours and I wanted to let you know I do have a print for you. I had to leave in rush because a friend who is in town and staying with me was at my front door and had to run back home. I realized I didnt give you my info so that once I made another print I could give it to you . Sorry I found a print that I did make and its yours for free Just contact me and its yours. take care : ) Hello , You were dancing to your music in your van this morning on the 101 freeway headed north . We flirted back and forth , and I loved your shy smile . I blew you a kiss and you caught it : ) I wish I could have said hello , but being on the freeway made that pretty impossible . I know this is a long shot , but was the best option i can think of to try to find you . If by chance you see this , I 'd love to hear from you . If you do write , please tell me what I was driving so I know it you . Here 's hoping ! D My presence exists only with you. Can you feel it now ? Could you feel me coming ? Did you retreat somewhere safer ? I would n't blame you . It 's terrifying here . I do n't know what 's more terrifying ... Be it the unfathomable extent to which life has changed ? Or the painfully beautiful memories I never even considered I could miss proving me wrong . A lifetime of memories ; compressed into a few distinct feelings : all equallyIntense , abrasive , soul piercing as one another . Ca n't shift my focus ... You overflow my mind , It 's splitting at the seams ; terrified of what it dreams The rain continues to fall Nostalgia prevails over all Will you notice me or look away ? Are you even there ?

Please contact me , Joe You were the tall brunette with near perfect body that farted in the bread last night . I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked `` Was that you ? You quickly replied `` No it was n't me ! As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence , but it was evident . I tried to get rid of the stench by waving two loaves of Ciabetta bread . You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner . You 're beautiful and even if you were a liar and fart like a Clydesdale I 'd love to meet up . Friends recognize each others limits and value each other enough to not continuing to cross those metaphorical lines . Friends value each other 's truth and respect each other enough to at least not lie . Nothing is one sided , odds are in favor of both sides having a role in the play . But there is a scale of acceptable behavior . There does exist something that 's referred to as fair play . I tried to have patience and I was very forgiving . Even willing to take you back for a twice broken trust . You put me through hell . Should n't have wasted our time killing each other. I 'm all out of fight.

Im looking for serious replies only ... ..Hurry up and get it ! ! ! LIMITED TIME ONLY ! ! ! ! ! The last ten years passed so quick that I have found myself in a place that I do not like . The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands .

He and I parted ways in the median around 8 and you passed by us -- back to the laundromat , earbuds in your ears , glasses on your nose , flip-flops on your feet -- walking in rhythm the whole time . You got on the F train this morning at about 8:30 AM with an older white gentleman . You had a star of David necklace on , a striped black and white shirt with some fitted jeans . You had a light colored coat on as well . You looked so cute and I wanted to talk to you but it seemed like you were riding with who could have been your dad .

If you need more details , I was wearing a white patterned shirt and came into the restaurant shortly after you did , and I think I heard you ask the desk worker for two forks . You 're a tall brunette and that 's all I 'll say ! Looking for Jordy , we met on the downtown C train , you asked me what happened to my eye ( I had a band-aid over a cut ) . We chatted & amp ; you made me laugh & amp ; blush . I had to rush getting off at my stop on 14th/8th ave . I 'd like our paths to cross again .

Gim me a shout . ; ) naOMi Why were you ok with watching me walk away ? Do you know how many times I just wanted to reach out and hold your hand ? I miss your smile and you telling me how uneventful your day was and that you like it that way. Then I would just glance at you sideways and smile. Maybe when you head home to read tonight , you 'll come across this post. Email me with your name in the subject line. Should have said something , but the subway is one place in NYC where women should n't have to be hit on relentlessly . But here I am , on craigslist , my this feels pointless. Anyway , I was wearing a a striped grey T with a blue red overshirt , speaking with a taller bald dude , you are beautiful , blonde , with pale blue eyes . We stared at each other for an uncomfortable amount of time . Damnit . Well here goes .

Even miss our convos ! Hope you 're being treated in the way you deserve . Hope you got what you were looking for and it is all that it is supposed to be . I really did think you were special even if I did n't show it and was always distant/aloof . I think I found mine . I hope I did , but still thoughts of our sporadic times come to mind . You were sitting i was standing next to you . You were in an orange tank top and bumped into my arm as you got off . Would love to get to know you over coffee We were on the train together around 6pm and we both stood right next to the door for a few stops . I got this vibe from you that you were interested in me . We got on the escalator and I stood behind you looking at your nice ass . I wanted to say something but was n't sure if you 'd like that . If it 's you and you want my attention , let me know.

I really do love you and I ca n't give up hope that at the least we will be friends .. I ca n't quit my soul wo n't let me Hi , You were very short and hot with a tiny skirt . We made a comment or two , tell me about what . But I want to meet if you are out there reading . Why are you doing this ? Is it entertaining for you ? Do you feel it 's somehow deserved ? Because she 's hot , a goddess , then she deserves to be objectified and written off of a person lacking in substance , unworthy of respect , of love ? I think you should step outside of your ego and take into consideration how your callousness can truly affect others . It 's not a game . About 12:30 today ( may 27 ) ... We were waiting for our orders and chatted a little. You were wearing a maroon sweater , black leggings and light brown Uggs . You have jet black hair with a couple of Bobby pins holding the side stragglers up , and an amazingly beautiful smile with full and oh so kissable ruby lips. In the hope you were also interested I 'm putting this message in a bottle for you. Have a great week ! ! You were sitting for a while in front of Keypoint when I walked by and then I happened to see you again at the Safeway entrance . I said hi but wish I could have thought of something more and interesting to say ... I was the guy with brown hair and beige shirt . You looked friendly , I would n't mind having a longer conversation : - ) Love , R. He moves his hips to the side a little bit and allows her knees room for leverage . She pulls her t-shirt up and over her head . Catching her hair , it falls behind her as she reaches to unhook her bra . The candlelight plays in images across her round breasts and flaccid nipples . She leans forward , placing one nipple to his wet lips as she pulls her pants off . First with one arm , then the other , she works the fabric down from her ankles until she is lying completely atop of him in nothing but cotton panties . He loves her creamy white skin and blinks hard to catch glimpses of her curves in the dim lighting . We met up at a study today , i thought you were pretty cute , you were awfully talkative and always seemed to have something to say . I would like to hang out , just chill and shit . You seem like you 'd make a cool friend Hey , Last night ( Tuesday , 5/26 ) , in the evening , we both were in the back-room on a mini platform watching the other guys going at it . Then , two guys came up to us , blew us and all eyes were on us . I noticed that you were the same guy when we both checked in at the same time ( I was behind you waiting for my turn to check in ) . You 're cute and I wished we could have done more together.. Perhaps again next time ? Tell me what I was wearing or what were you wearing when we checked in , so I know it 's you . Hope to hear from you . Hello ladies , I 'm a handsome man who loves to pleassure women . I am sweet and kind , someone who loves to give and make women happy .

Today , I was buying some stuff and I saw you girl walking on the same aisle , you were talking on the phone as you passed behind me I wanted to say you had beautiful eyes , but I reacted kind of slow .

In the unlikely event that you see this ad contact me , I want to tell you and not keep it inside me : ) . I can tell you what you were wearing , just to be sure it 's you . Two years later . Well almost three . I ca n't forget you . I know you 're living in sin with her , and she 'll bankrupt you into having a baby . You did n't want complications so it 's ironic you are catering to her wanting a baby . It will get old . Then you will cheat on her like you did with me , with your wife , with every girl that has crossed your path . Cheaters do n't change , but I still care about you . I still am in love with you . I keep wondering how you are . If you ever find yourself lonely ( and you will , trust me ) and need someone , I 'm here . I will always be waiting for you . my friends joke around with me , refer to you as my boyfriend . my crush is so big and obvious . if i did n't have scruples i 'd try to make something happen . but we 're both married with kiddos so it will never be . too sticky . plus you seem much too noble to ever even go there . i like that about you but at the same time it makes me want defile you all night long ... . you 're the hottest dad around though . i just had to get it outta my head . mc seems like the most appropriate place to do that .

And yesterday I realized , that there 's something else that I like about Logos as well . You 're about 6 ' 1 - I 'd guess b/c I 'm 6 ' and you look a little taller - w long dark hair in a center part that comes down past your shoulders and you wear studious sort of glasses . Yesterday you had on jeans and a button down . You look close to my age ( I 'm 31 ) and you 've got a lean , cowboy kind of build , but look like the kind of guy who goes home to Thelonious Monk and Thomas Pynchon . I think you 've worked at Logos for some years now - 3 ? - but yesterday when you guided me to Dark Sun the history of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes I felt a little flutter in my heart that had nothing to do with nuclear energy. I do n't live in Santa Cruz ( Oakland is my home ) but if I did , I 'd come up with a lot more books for you to help me find . I 'm usually in SC once a month . And you might not be the kind of guy that 's into guys . But I am . And if you are too , I 'd love to buy you coffee sometime . Or even if you 're hetero , I know we both love books , so we 'll still have something to talk about . : ) We are a team of elite movers and shakers in Tech . We were in contact with the most excellent problem solver and reframer in the history of mankind but lost her email . Can you help us ? She just looks amazing in those boots and that 's definitely why we messed up -- it 's a scientific fact that our brains do n't work . All we remember is that she is HOT and a GODDESS but ca n't fill in any other freakin ' details ! ! ! ! Please help us ... .. you will know when you run into her because you will think she is incompetent I 'm missing you , my lovely shoreline park friend .

Are you still out there playing ? I did not think it would be this hard to have no contact with you. Please let me know how things are going for you . I hope you are happy. Still love you. Your Lobster Exchanged some looks and smiles in Pegasus on Memorial Day ... .should have talked to you ? I was making fun of my friend and we all smiled . Well , email might work better . This could be for anyone . Or do you mean for the billion or so readers that we are all too late ? Not sure if you decided not to chat more , or if the temporary Craigslist email addresses expired. Either Way , could you get a hold of me so I know ? Dennis I asked how mans sets you had left . You are very sexy and I 'd like to get together . If you see this and are interested , let me know what machine and how many set you had . The happiest place on earth was inside your heart and especially inside your mouth , vagina and anus - you hot Pinay . I should have married you . You are a voluptuous white woman wearing jeans and red tshirt that said `` Application ? Driving a gray color mini truck. Me white man pumping gas at booth island. You are probably taken , but if not where do I fill out that application ? I got it bad for you . I should have approached you but I saw movement in the front seat so I held my ground . When you drove away , there was a nice looking brindle pit with you . I Wish I would have known . We 'd probably be talking right now . It 's been awhile and I lost your contact info . I would love to see you again . You work in Napa area and I work in Sebastopol area . If this is you , name the PARK we met at . It is a challenge to connect with a stranger during a crowded BART commute . This morning I wanted to say hi to you . I tried to do it with my eyes , but that was n't quite enough. You have a nice open face . You got off at Montgomery at about 9:20 . Black pants , black boots to your knee , black blazer , black and white stripped shirt . What was distinctive ? The stud earring in your upper left ear . I was wearing a green shirt with a tie . We both are married and good friends ( you are good friend of my wife ) . We both know that we want each other but could n't say it openly ( though you mentioned in a party on the weekend that you have hearts for me ... you were drunk ) . You are petite and I am tall Indian guy . We both think a like and very practical . I badly want you ... you have no idea how many times I fantasized about you . Will you we able to keep it a secret and enjoy ? Hope you see this and reply back . I am N and you are M. We passed each other outside the doors at Palace Art & amp ; Supply in Capitola on Monday afternoon . You were super cute , black hair , nose ring , jeans , etc , and scowling , I was scowling too . Mine was for my current project sapping the life force out of me , which is why I fumbled until you had passed . Maybe yours was for a similar art project or at the bright sun , or at me . Maybe we can inspire each other . Maybe we can go get supplies at the same time next week ? Moving his hand from her face , he caresses her long hair . Taking the lightest dark locks in between his fingers , he twirls these parts of her fast until they pull taut and fall back to her shoulders . He enjoys this game , pulling her to him in these small bits until , slightly tortured , she falls back to her own side . He touches her soft cheek , hoping that touch will suffice for words until he has time to think things through . She smiles , happily accepting the affectionate gesture from her new lover . The brightness in her eyes takes him almost by surprise . She never seems to smile anymore . `` Dammit , he tells himself , `` Kiss her , hug her or something . . . . Either response would be too simple to explain the complexity of emotions he feels for her . She yields to his desire , turning her head to the other side and exposing her untouched skin . Deliberately , he runs the flat of his wet tongue over the salt of her neck . He does n't bite yet , but moves over her until she lies flat on top of the lumped up bed covers . From this pinned position , she comes alive . Moving only her hands , she manages to pull his t-shirt out of his belt and half way up over his back . She runs her tiny hands over the warmed , exposed skin and kisses him with a passion incomparable to that of his deviant biting . Her strong thighs wrap around his waist , pulling him to her in one swift surge . Whatever her doubts and insecurities were , she finds no solace in her concerns . Rather , she rolls over with him until she is in a half sitting position on top of his clothed body . Ravenously , she kisses him with vengeance until the saliva from within her cheeks drips easily from his slick lips . To the super cute woman I bumped into twice at two places in 10 mins , I was thoroughly charmed and I am now painfully bewitched ... Wanted to ask you to lunch but was too late in the parking lot ... . Write to me , you cutie : ) This seldom happens to me , but man it did today ! You rang me up this afternoon at ACE Hardware in Sebastopol . I saw a quick glimpse of your eyes during a typical friendly exchange at first , and could n't believe what I saw. No ... ..could n't be ... ... . But it so was true ! The biggest hazel deep green , sparkly , fantastically incredible gorgeous eyes I 've even seen ! We looked at each other as I gave you some cash , I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the money thing . Then you gave me change , I think I may have said have a great afternoon , but I locked onto , and into those perfectly clear pools of hypnotic green for what seemed like minutes ! And heres the part that seldom happens to me , they stayed with me all day and into the evening ! Like I had just left you moments ago ! I could so look at those eyes again ! Thank you ! Crossed paths at the Mexican market there Miller Ave. on Monday I think . I was next in line behind you . Would like to sit and have coffee with you , my treat . You were also wearing a black tank top . I was in the vehicle with writing on it . Sat across from you and your friend at Starbucks Monday morning . You : tall , tight gray shorts ... I 'm guessing from San Francisco . Saw you again Tuesday morning . Hit me up . We sat next to each other at the bar and talked a little bit . We made a bet on the warriors game . I thought you were really attractive , but I did n't get your number . If you see this , let me know the details of our bet ! Long shot , but we played for a few minutes at the Jacks party last night . We were both in the lobby afterwards . As you were leaving , I think you said `` Thanks for letting me join .

She holds his hand by the tips of his fingers and enjoys feeling the familiar bend in his hand as he lights candles with his other hand . Fumbling , he places the candle atop the desk and moves her to his bed. She sits , patiently attentive to her thoughts , on top of the jumbled bed clothes and watches him take off his shoes with delicate balance . Holding her face , he kisses her on both cheeks before removing her glasses and placing them on the nightstand . The kisses feel good to her and she enjoys the warm breath on her goospimpled skin . Again , he kisses her softly on the face as he moves his stubbled framed mouth to her smooth lips . She pulls back slightly , startled at the roughness of his three day beard , but resumes relaxation as his kisses move from her mouth to her neck . I asked you for a light you told me the night before you drank way too much I told you how to cure that. Your BF is a bartender. I saw you glancing after we talked outside. I was looking too. I 'll have to have more dreams about `` what if ... How do i ask u to ? How do I suppress my selfish need to explore other sexual experiences while wanting u all to myself . I want to make out and cuddle with her then come home and fall deeper in love with u. I need a reboot once in a while from a real throbbing penis , but have no desire to commit to a man . We have been through so much and when my dying day comes I wanthyou holding my hand , raising our children . I 'm asking u to be stronger than me , I 'm askingbyou to let me wander while you stay faithful to me ! She gently tosses her head to one side and the dim light catches under her eyes in what almost seems to be a leery , ominous glow of intensity . He ca n't tell if she is still smiling because her face is tilted slightly to one side , but he can hear her unsure , off rhythm breath clearly . `` Come on he says , gently pulling her up from her knees . He knows he 's taking a chance with her since he 's not quite sure where they stand , but the moment is too much for him to ignore . She stands slowly , not quite sure what she thinks of the situation -- of him -- but follows him into the bedroom . and wonder is he looking at at it too ? Will he return your text if you contacted him ? What would he say if you showed up at his door ? You miss at how his hugs and caresses melted your problems away even if it was for a few days. You miss at how his flirting , laughter made you smile , laugh and brought you joy. You miss at how he magically would make the darkness disappear for a while. You miss at how his passionate kisses would make your toes curl. Then you realize , the reason he is not there still exists. He wanted more than you were willing to give. He was unwilling to accept less than he wanted. He was tired of being pushed away every time you felt the need to run away. He was tired of being the one you called only when you felt abandoned by others. You do not miss that he easily brought you sadness when he pushed back as you push him away. Sometimes events , people remind him of you like someone did last night . Sometimes events , people remind you of him . Sometimes you just want to snuggle up to him one last time , see if the fire and passion are in his kisses ... Looking for another sister CD to live with in santa rosa as a roommate. Been dress for a long time and wish to dress with other like minded cd. Room is very nice and clean and we share home. asking 600. Age open or closet cd is fine with me. SEND e-mail with pic so we can start this. Room is ready 6-1-15. You were by yourself , leaving as I was going in . You definitely looked at me and smiled , I thought you were very pretty and would like to say `` Hi and get to know you . I am older . I did n't mean to be rude by walking by without saying anything . You looked nervous , really pretty but nervous . I wanted to say something but I get it . Well I do n't understand any of it but I 'm not trying to come at you if you do n't want me to . I still hope you would hit me up . Hey today I walked in and ordered a drink . You were the cute cashier . With curly brownish hair and a cute smile . I thought you were hot . starbucks on capitol expressway and McLaughlin . were both the same age it was around 11.20 . You were a cute , fun loving woman dancing samba by the water ; ) . You can shake ! Was torn between watching your sensual moves or your radiant smile when you danced . You were there with friends . We smiled , we talked after the event . I wanted to dance with you later that night but you had someone. We share a mutual acquaintance , used to live in the same city , enjoyed a witty quick conversation that ended too soon. Long shot , but hey better than not trying . Christine , I 've thought about you a lot over the years and I think we really could have made a great couple . Do you believe in second chances ? We could be great together . -T Last saw you a couple of weeks ago . We were supposed to hang out again . Where did you disappear to ? You seemed like a great gal who loves the outdoors , we talked for a minute and then continued on . I think we met on Rough Go . Woe to me for not saying more ! But now I am asking , would you like to meet again , for a hike , or a drink , or both ? : ) You introduced yourself as Crystal and partnered with me at the ballroom dance lessons , and you showed me how to Waltz . I was n't planning to go to the Ball but I went in hopes of seeing you again . We danced even though I did n't know how to dance , and I told you that I was really only there so I would have a chance to dance with you again . I realized afterwards that was a mistake because of how awkward it made things . I 'm sorry I made you so uncomfortable . I hope you still had a great rest of the night , and that you find someone who treats you right because I think you are very special . Hi Corey. You were at the Cafe with friends . I was looking at the apartment ads when you were out having a cigarette . this was about 830pm . Should have given you my phone number then . Lets meet up ! Just tell me where you live , so I know it is you . I exist now dreaming in reality , shades of deep reds and grays , Evolving at the speed of light As my third eye sees all , I bring my fingers to my lips and time stops I taste you. I ponder you and wallow in the memory of your scent and way. How you called me baby The way you made me laugh The way you touched my heart and made me believe Unable to stop , it seems too wonderful , but in the end there is not much but pain. I allow this for some time , then I awake and know that I am alive and the possibilities are endless. Wanting you to taste my soul and undeniably know that I am the one and we are one to conquer happiness together , unimaginably , the way you knew that we could and will if you say one word , Yes ! Your fear . Your ego . Your pride . They protect and also hurt you , keeping you from what is rightfully yours , Love. If I had your heart again ? Oh , the way I would touch it , nurture it and protect it My most sacred gift God wants what I want , he trusts me and knows my light is pure as he does you. Say the word once. The heavens will open up and the angels will sing in our praise Because we chose. Please do n't be afraid , I am always here for you. I 'LL MISS YOU IM LEAVING THE U.S . I HAVE NOBODY TO COME BACK TO SO WHY COME BACK AT ALL ... WITH SO MANY PEOPLE OUT HEAR THATS LOOKING FOR LOVE ITS FUNNY THAT ANY OF US ARE SINGLE ITS ALL ABOUT INTERNET HOOK UPS WHAT ITS LIKE EVERYONE HAS BECOME A DRONE ? CANT DATE YOU LET ME LOOK YOU UP WOW ! ! ! ! ! be open or shut yourself in a closet and HIDE from everyone stop hatting yourself Wow there 's so many beautiful girls in san Francisco and even on the bart train from different countries and cities . I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE TO MEET A PERSON AND START A FRIENDSHIP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GOES FROM THERE . Saw you on the bench reading and picking your nose . I walked by several times to get your attention but you seemed preoccupied with the nose thing . I had on grey shorts and tennies . Tell me where the bench was to make sure it 's you . I left work because you freed me from it . I had it all along - you ! My knowledge -- & gt ; wisdom -- & gt ; success w/o you ? = uncertainty You : I love you. Me : I love you more. I agreed with what somethings you said , no backsies , takebacks ... with YOU . That 's my rule. HA ! ! ! I was wanted you to smile . I also want to give you a hug , a kiss on the neck . actually a hug in bed would be nice as well Have your boss call me should she have questions . I can explain it to him . He watches over you. it 's ok . I can dance , sing later ... You were working the drive thru . Newark on jarvis . You are so beautiful Hispanic woman with black or brown curly hair and a lovely smile I was breathtaking . I did n't have time to say something and I did n't want to get you in to trouble . But I enjoyed locking eyes and smile with you . If you see this I would like to get together and go for coffee or Ice cream together or something . I miss the way you closed your eyes when I kissed you. I wish I could kiss you again . Wow , I did n't think anything about meeting someone at the drive thru , then I got to the window , we shared a little bit , and then I left . I have n't stopped thinking about you , I think we had a connection . I you feel the same message me back , put the name of the restaurant in the subject line , hope to hear from you soon . As I was leaving the farmers market , you were getting out of your car and then getting stuff out of the passenger 's side . You were wearing these navy yoga pants , and you were arcing your back and bending your hips in just such a way ... well , I could n't not stare . And I know you caught me staring ( off the reflection on your car ) . So - first , sorry for staring . Second , if it 's not weird to say , thank you . Your butt was the highlight of my day . Absolutely incredible ; ) If you write , tell me what color and make your car is. I posted here in a time of weakness and pain . You used it as an opportunity to judge me and browbeat me with your evangelical Christian brainwashing . You judged me as being in pain because I needed Jesus . You are dangerously misinformed about your own outer religion . when I responded to thank you but point out Mathhew 6:5 - do n't be like the hypocrites - and the Book of Job - bad things happen to great people and you should n't judge - you flew into a rage . This has happened three other times that I 've posted here . I did not ask for help or to be evangelized . I was merely telling my story . You use Jesus to aggrandize your own ego . I 'm literally thinking every day of killing myself and you are out there trying to make me feel even worse about myself through your idea of religion . You get a good feeling out of telling other people you are holier than they are when they are down . You are just awful . I should be free FROM your religion . Hey We chatted at the bar , your name was Hannah and you said you teach in San Mateo . I wish I had asked you out , but you left ... .. You were going to see Dior and I , I was in the lobby waiting for friends . We smiled and said hello . Would love to meet you . We could not keep our eyes from eachother ... You in your black leather jacket and kids , me in black shirt and jeans . I tried to figure out a way to come introduce myself but you seemed to be with your family ! You 'll never see this I 'm sure but just for fun You were in the yellow muscle shirt . I was staring and admiring your beautiful , large hard pecs . You smiled big at me , and I got embarrassed . I 'm working on that -- should have said hi . Hi ? We met on the beach with our dogs . I told you I loved red hair . When you told me you were a high school teacher I told you the boys must be hot for you . You said you were stressed from finals . I can help . We can go to nude beach and be totally free and relaxed then my place where I have massage table for a sensual full body massage then I would give you totally oral bliss . And that just the beginning BABY , I AM SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW I TREATED YOU.LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS NO GOOD , YOUR MY SUNSHINE , MY BABY GIRL .I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AND START NEW ! I COULD TYPE FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT I WISH OR WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD RATHER BE LOOKING INTO YOUR SEXY BROWN EYES AND TELLING YOU INPERSON ... .THIS SUCKS BABY : I NEED YOU , WANT YOU , MISS YOU ! GIVE ME A CHANCE AND HEAR ME OUT , PLEASE ... ... IF YOU READ THIS , CALL ME SO WE CAN TALK , PLEASE ! OR EMAIL ME ! SO I KNOW ITS YOU , WERE WAS OUR FIRST KISS ? ? ? ? ? ? Ps ... ... i love you baby ! Leoncio Navarro i really want to see you . If your attached or not . Please find me . T I have moments in my day when I think about us . I do n't cry anymore , sigh at times and maybe clear my throat , but it 's not at all like the first time . I have realized that the greatest gift you gave me was the lesson in loving myself and realizing my worth . It may have come at a cost , because in that very process I learned that our failures were not worth carrying around but rather to be placed under my feet and used as stepping stones to something better. I ca n't begin to tell you how many times I have ended something with someone simply because your voice echoes in my head `` you are better than that , you deserve more I always credit you for my change of behavior and even though it makes me want to scream at times , I am most pleased with the outcome : - ) your love paved the way to a healthier me and I needed you to know that it was not all for nothing ! In some attempts , it is glorious even to fail I saw you in Carls Jr in Martinez SATURDAY about 6 or 7pm . You were with another girl & amp ; some young dude . You had pushed a baby stroller to your table . When I first saw you , I was so hooked . I could n't take my eyes off you . I left a note for you to find , I pray . Then when I drove away , past the window where you were sitting , ... you and the other chick were totally staring at me , & amp ; both of you were waving at me . YOU MADE MY YEAR , ..THANK YOU SO MUCH ! ! I 'M THE `` BEAVER PLEASER & amp ; I 'd love 2 lick your sweet Beaver again and again and again and again just to see your BEAUTIFUL SMILE .

CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME ! So , you were at 90 's night tonight and you were by far the coolest human there . Your moves were solid across the board , and you were clearly there for the music , not to hook up , which is why I Ieft you way the hell alone ( also : social anxiety ) . BUT ( and this is a big but ) , it maybe seemed like you could be could be interested , or maybe I am totally off base . You were present , but , like , never actively pursuing , so it 's hard to tell . Anyway , um , you had light jeans on and a tight black top that really highlighted your quite exquisite back . I was just , you know , a white human , black shirt , basically the most boring thing ever . But I promise I am at least a little cool , if you did want to reach out . K. Good night . Too weak and tired to write much tonight ; why is my muse not bringing me coffee and rolling me with a rolling pin ? It 's in the job description . Anyhow , this is the best I can do tonight , despite all the beautiful women in the world ... : -/ The nIght of the hot red things I 've seen big cafeterias And vaulted marble ceilings , I 've seen dark things mysterious And people with no feelings I 've seen bright fields of roses And golden onion domes , I 've seen misshapen noses , And brand new mobile homes I 've seen two tits to die for , And Martin Luther King , I 've seen San Bernardino , And damn near everything ! But something that I 'm missing Which it seems I need to see , Is a year or two of kissing you , In the third degree ! Three More Bloody Haikuses Not infrequently I feel like I will die Love is a life boat Thinking of your face At times when you look happy Helps me to survive Following one 's heart Leads one through flaming canyons And down to the beach If I need you more than I want you ... I never want to go back to how life was before do n't know why I did n't invite you up to my place on Sonoma mtn rd your sharp and beautiful are you spontaneous im here your ? ? ? the 4 of diamonds -the 4of hearts -- the four makes five that 's a winning hand e Hey stud I saw you the other night you were my server .

You worked at Carls Jrs ( Union and Camden ) I ate there almost every weekend since November 2012 till December 2013. Dulce , you probably remember me . You sighed virtually every time you saw me . How are you ? You were upstairs having a drink with your friends sitting on a stool overlooking the drunk dancers . You wore glasses and a white top and I could just tell you had a good vibe to you . Would love to get to know you better . You came in looking for a restroom..Then came back with a smile to update me..I wish we had just a minute longer I 'm wondering if you saw me ?

I looked thru the window and between the fence , you were wearing black fitness pants with a yellowish top and a Scarlett scarf/headband . If you saw me ? Let me know . Never thought I 'd see my girl til I saw you tonight . You were at the corner of 23rd and Castro making a left , listening to Pac and smoking a cigarette . You stopped me in my tracks and I could n't look away . I was walking up 23rd backwards looking at you take a drag off that smoke while you made the left . Silver Hyundai .

If you see this and you do n't wan na reach out I just got ta say keep doin you , it looks like it 's working . You know no one does it it like you . When I was sad , I let myself be sad .

I wish the best for you . I was really good to you . I just love your secret smile . I do n't think I 'll post here again . I 'm in a place of peace and hope . I am even more puzzled , than hurt .

I do n't think you 've realized it but every single time ive walked into your jobs , this and the one before and unless im mistaken theres one that was before that but I just liked to go and kinda check you out , its been with the intent to ask you out on a date . I really suck at it . I see you almost daily at World Gym and we exchange smiles every now and then . I wish I can say more or be any more descriptive , but if I did I 'll reveal who you are . If you think it is you that I am talking about , send me an email with what you were wearing at the gym today . Hi Cutie , You were sitting next to me at a stop light and you reached back to roll the window down so your son could say hi to me. HMU -- let 's chat . We had some hot fun a month or two again and I 'd love to feed you my cock again . I loved your submissive and how you too my thick cock Respond back with what we did and how you look so I know its you Hope to hear from you ; I donthave grindr anymore so lost contact I hope , I hope you see this . I was sitting at the window counter sipping an iced tea and reading . You were in line and then you sat next to me while you waited for your drink . I could n't think of anything to say but what I wanted to say was . `` hi , I love you hair Cute boots. You look to be about 50-55 grey hair , stocky build ... .you were wearing nice blue plaid type shirt and had your face buried in the paper . We exchanged glances a few times I thought you were very nice looking , any way if you are into guys and remember my greeting , say hello and see where this nice bottom guy can take you ... . If the stars align perhaps we can meet again ... ... . Damn this short attention span I was perfectly content on my island , but you came in like a monsoon , sucking me out to sea . Floating in the warmth of your intentions . The calm winds began to change , sputtering gusts at first . Tropical blasts battered followed by arctic chills sending me so off course there was no hope of finding my way back . Now I 'm left adrift , watching the compass spin , knowing that the next rush will be the final blow that drowns me . Please just put me back where you found me . Good looking tall black guy wearing scrubs and a jacket . Made eye contact several times . Discreet professional white guy here standing across from you . Would love to connect if you see this . Let me know what was on your jacket so I know it 's you . I know I probably enjoyed that just as much , if not more than you . i wanted to add a few sweet little kisses in here and there on your neck and shoulder area but it would have been a little bit improper.i hope you take me up on my offer , a little bit of privacy and better setting will make a world 's difference . i promise to remain a complete gentleman the entire time and respect any limitations you may have.just keep in mind im willing to go the extra mile ... ... . Just wondering how many women have been left in the wake of your desires ? How many times have you walked the line of improper with promises of respect and being a gentleman ?

I 'm the one with the bike and the bike clothes , sitting there in the seat wishing I could just say something , but then Embarcadero comes and I have to get off because I 'm going to work , flying around the city , delivering goods . I would love to actually get to talk to you , but this biker is very shy . I do n't know if you 'll be there the next time I ride and each time I can only hope .

I am looking for relationship and love ... . You Latin looking bear with that hot beard hanging around at closing . Me stocky masculine bearded white linebacker who wanted to seriously put your legs over my shoulders and make you beg . This is a long shot but if you are out there reading this and interested HMU. Tell me what it is about your beard that is different so I know it 's you . 24 Hour Fitness , SuperSport on Crane To the cute girl with glasses jogging around between sets , I 'm glad you took an extra lap by me as I was finishing up . Definitely gave me something to remember this weekend. Not my usual gym or workout time , but maybe I 'll see you around I wanted to pullover to talk to you . You are VERY sexy . If this is you , and you 're interested , please reply and tell me what my vehicle was so I know it was you . I just wanted to say thank you for your compassion . My girlfriend and I were there with our dog who we ended up having to let go . From the exam room I heard the tech apologizing for the wait and could hear you saying it was no problem , that you understood ... I would like to think that most people in your shoes would feel the same way , but working in a veterinary hospital myself , I know that people can be amazingly insensitive and selfish when made to wait under similar circumstances . So thank you so much for your kindness , patience , and compassion . I hope your dog is okay , he was really cute and under any other circumstances I would have given him all the attention he seemed to want from us ! Take care , and please know that your small kindness made a big difference to us on that very painful night . As I came out of Trader Joes you were there with your children and you looked at me like you knew me and you said Hi and you took my breath you were so beautiful . I am pretty sure I said Hi back but I walked straight to my car . OMG you were so beautiful and I ca n't shake that feeling that you must know me . as God is my witness , love will prevail . I have you in my sights , and , to quote our nasal friend Mr. Declan P. MacManus , `` My aim is true ! `` C. x S. I had suitcases , you had ( blank ) . Very sexy eyes , gave me great thoughts through the day ... . You- Beauty in a light blue suv. Me- Red shirt , white truck. I should n't have gotten off at my exit ... You had no makeup on , white shirt with black yoga pants . You have a beautiful face . I was by you on bart with a grey sweatshirt . Lets talk ... .email me and tell me its you by saying what oakland stop you got off at ... . I know this is a long shot but you were wearing a north face coat earlier this week . I saw you by bart , you had glasses on . This is to just say hi and maybe become friends , nothing else , you look like you have a lot on your mind and could use a person to talk to . I dont have any ill intentions just friends . I am a man and would respect any situation your in . I saw this couple near Mission/15th and the male was being very aggressive and looked like he was about to be abusive . I 'd really like to know whether this was a school experiment to see what passersby would say . It freaked me out and I 'd like to ease my mind . ( I did yell at him that I 'd taken his picture so he better not hurt her but I had kids in the car so I felt I could n't do more . ) You look fancy in that somewhat short green skirt . You got good legs and an attractive look and physique . I got into pumping gas seeing you were pumping gas in the pump near De Anza Park : ) Seems you noticed I looked at you - may be not , could not be sure. You are pretty. I 've seen you while riding my bike down Shattuck while you wait for the 18 . I have seen you a few times on the 18 towards Albany/Solano , also . You usually get on somewhere around Alcatraz , I think , sometimes on Ashby. We 've smiled at each other pleasantly , though I 've always wanted to strike up a conversation with you , despite you wearing headphones ( and I recognize that 's maybe the point of wearing them and I do not fault you for wanting to be left alone on public transit ) . I 'm a tall , bearded , glasses-wearing goober who is often reading or slipping back and forth between awake and asleep thanks to the early hour and the warm bus ride . I think we 'd get along , though I ca n't really say why. Would you be interested in getting a pint or a tumbler or a cuppa something sometime ? I would relish the opportunity to get to know you better . Hi , Beautiful girl who was sitting next to me on IHSS Orientation at 1 pm today . You left your SS card in the car . Please get back to me if you read this. Greg Easily the prettiest/hottest/sexiest woman I think I have ever seen ! Seriously . Super model style . Anyone else notice how perfect that woman was ? Grey denim . Bun . Painted toes . Trying my best to be respectful. Anyways , made my day as I stood in that shitty line . So big thanks , to the brunette who , I 'm assuming is a model . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . * I do n't take much shit from ladies , *even the sexy/hot girls . EVER . I would let this woman walk all over me like a loser . Actually I would n't . But some dude is a lucky S.O.B. This is whats up to that cute ass asian working out at the Fremont 24 by Bart around the noon time . Just saying whats up tho . I have n't seen you in so long . I 've made too many mistakes to make it right . I hope you 're doing well . I love you ... forever I 'm lost for words . Yes , me . I know it took a lot for you to do that . Thank you but just know that I 'm trying to make `` sense of it . Even though I do n't think `` sense has anything to do with this ( smile ) . I will admit , you scare me a little bit , but in a good way . Please be patient with me , I do n't know what to do and that is the truth. I was the gent that waved to you and thought that you were so wonderful ! I am hoping if you are single that you would go out with me for a coffee date ? If interested let me know ok ... ... . sincerely me ... . You get me off the equipment I was using so you could complete your routine I would love to get to know you better and i wish you end up reading this Tell me which equipment I was using I 'm looking to find and reconnect with you , we met and went on a couple dates . You were really nice and pretty . Curvy , had a nose ring , pretty short hair from what I remember and tattoos . Things ended but I wish they did n't . Please reply . You 've recently worked with my family putting in a sport court . I 'm not really the type to post something like this but you 've been on my mind ever since you came by to show us your tiles . I 've heard through the grapevine that your a divorced dad of one . Is there any chance you 'd be interested in a divorced mom of one ? I 'm secure , sane , and your sense of humor is right up my ally . I hope I hear back . I 'm mixed black and white , short hair , glasses and beard You said your name was _hil , ''like Phil , but with a _ . and that you were headed to Temescal to meet with some friends. You were kind of tall and handsome and had a very mellow and confident demeanor and you had a skirt on . I said I smoked too much weed .

Hi , you were in line behind me at TJ today in Nob Hill . This is kind of a shot in the dark , but we were reviewing all my items and you seemed very nice , never mind cute . Thanks for letting me know I almost forgot my plant ! Coffee sometime ? ... that after three grueling years I may have finally turned the corner health-wise . A misread MRI and a therapist who knows the correct course of treatment give me hope where there was none . So this is a good chance to thank you for the support you have given me in your own special way . It 's been nothing short of astonishing ... I literally do n't know how I would have survived without you . I truly do n't know where your heart lies , I think you can feel my confusion when I go off on one of my jackass rifts ... if it 's with someone else , that makes your support of me even more amazing . You are an angel , one sent here to help me through my darkest hour and if I can ever do anything for you all you need do is pick up the phone . Whoever you love is the luckiest person on the face of this earth and should never take that for granted . xxoo Met you at the bar , I only stayed for a quick beer.. You are from PA and here on business . I wanted to buy you a drink but I was in a hurry . Maybe we can meet up for a drink when you 're back in the area ? You showed me a birthday card you were purchasing and we talked about the beer I was purchasing . Would love to hear from you -- should have talked to you then . Sigh . Little chance of hearing from you here , but who knows . Ahoy ! Our names start with an M. You have a fantastic personality and I 'd love to meet you again .

You were at the cash machine on Thursday morning around 8:30 AM . You had your hair colored red . Something about your simplicity and your naturalness really got me staring at you , was shy to approach you as I thought you might not be interested in a 40 year old guy . If you see this , hope you respond back . Love your personality and overall rad vibe. I 'd love to get to know you better. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. I 've seen you a couple times and I 'm amazed by you tall gorgeous smile . I think you noticed me checking you out.Never posted on here but I 'm shy and a bit intimidated . Doubt you 'll see this but if you do please say hi . You are and older yet fit white man . You are always wearing black or gray sleeveless shirts and shorts . We always make eye contact when you are on a stationary bike in the front . You are on there all the time before you work out and post workout . I overheard someone call you and your name is john . Super sexy man . I also saw you driving off in a BMW . We locked eyes and smiled to each other on BART . You even looked back when you got off at Montgomery Street . I tried to find you but got lost in the shuffle . I walked around the block and even went to Starbucks , just for a chance to say hi. Me : Young guy in a yellow/gray hoodie. You : Beautiful brunette in a slim-fitting dress with black leggings and red lipstick. I felt something this morning . If you did too , please respond . This is uncharacteristic but ca n't get you out of my head so figured I give this a shot. It was last Saturday . I stopped into Rite Aid . You were working the register closest to the door. A beautiful brunette with glasses . You said hello , I said it back . I grabbed what I needed and stood in line . We made eye contact a few times while waiting . Maybe you thought I was suspicious , maybe something else . I ended up at the other register . We made eye contact again . On my way out I said goodbye and you responded back. I 'm not sure what your situation is but I ca n't shake you. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile . Please message me back if there is something real or it was all in my head J Mathilda says hi . Too bad you 've been banned my friend . I just hope you did n't get wasted on coconut water to compensate ... Wow you are super cute ! I could n't stop staring at you as you walked through the cross . I gave a smile you gave one back and then , , , I noticed your bum and you looked back and caught me , guess i was n't to discrete . I hope I did n't creep you out , sorry , but you are adorable . I hope you see this and know I 'm gon na be day dreaming about you and your amazing body , probably for the rest of the week. Thanks for walking in front of my truck ! Sorry for the misunderstanding . I have good intentions ... just asking for peace nothing more . Hope I did n't offend you . Have a nice day . : - ) This post was a fine post , in addition I think it should be added that often enough a relationship can become so strained that one or both parties decide that the relationship is beyond an ability to reconcile . We 're all grown ups though , we all know that . While I believe in mutual understanding , understandably it 's a well that can go dry . Like anything if you do n't take care of the things you have , you ca n't expect to keep it . Honesty is probably a key factor . Responsibility for ones actions another in reconciliation. I like this topic I see you all the time , and love your smiles and your sexy outfits.Always look forward to seeing you cross paths with me.If your interest is piqued , respond to this and I will share some more details .

Hi Sam , Hopefully this gets to her or someone she knows . I am a classmate of yours and I wanted to let you know I do have a print for you. I had to leave in rush because a friend who is in town and staying with me was at my front door and had to run back home.

Sorry I found a print that I did make and its yours for free Just contact me and its yours. take care : ) Hello , You were dancing to your music in your van this morning on the 101 freeway headed north . We flirted back and forth , and I loved your shy smile . I blew you a kiss and you caught it : ) I wish I could have said hello , but being on the freeway made that pretty impossible . I know this is a long shot , but was the best option i can think of to try to find you . If by chance you see this , I 'd love to hear from you . If you do write , please tell me what I was driving so I know it you . Here 's hoping ! D My presence exists only with you. Can you feel it now ? Could you feel me coming ? Did you retreat somewhere safer ? I would n't blame you . It 's terrifying here . I do n't know what 's more terrifying ... Be it the unfathomable extent to which life has changed ? Or the painfully beautiful memories I never even considered I could miss proving me wrong . A lifetime of memories ; compressed into a few distinct feelings : all equallyIntense , abrasive , soul piercing as one another . Ca n't shift my focus ...

Please contact me , Joe You were the tall brunette with near perfect body that farted in the bread last night . I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked `` Was that you ? You quickly replied `` No it was n't me ! As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence , but it was evident . I tried to get rid of the stench by waving two loaves of Ciabetta bread . You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner . You 're beautiful and even if you were a liar and fart like a Clydesdale I 'd love to meet up . Friends recognize each others limits and value each other enough to not continuing to cross those metaphorical lines . Friends value each other 's truth and respect each other enough to at least not lie . Nothing is one sided , odds are in favor of both sides having a role in the play . But there is a scale of acceptable behavior . There does exist something that 's referred to as fair play . I tried to have patience and I was very forgiving . Even willing to take you back for a twice broken trust . You put me through hell . Should n't have wasted our time killing each other. I 'm all out of fight.

The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands .

You forgot your detergent and had to go back home around 6:45 . I was standing on the corner , waiting for my friend to arrive for dinner , when you walked by . He and I parted ways in the median around 8 and you passed by us -- back to the laundromat , earbuds in your ears , glasses on your nose , flip-flops on your feet -- walking in rhythm the whole time . You got on the F train this morning at about 8:30 AM with an older white gentleman . You had a star of David necklace on , a striped black and white shirt with some fitted jeans . You had a light colored coat on as well . You looked so cute and I wanted to talk to you but it seemed like you were riding with who could have been your dad .

We made a comment or two , tell me about what . But I want to meet if you are out there reading . Why are you doing this ? Is it entertaining for you ? Do you feel it 's somehow deserved ? Because she 's hot , a goddess , then she deserves to be objectified and written off of a person lacking in substance , unworthy of respect , of love ? I think you should step outside of your ego and take into consideration how your callousness can truly affect others . It 's not a game . About 12:30 today ( may 27 ) ... We were waiting for our orders and chatted a little. You were wearing a maroon sweater , black leggings and light brown Uggs . You have jet black hair with a couple of Bobby pins holding the side stragglers up , and an amazingly beautiful smile with full and oh so kissable ruby lips. In the hope you were also interested I 'm putting this message in a bottle for you. Have a great week ! ! You were sitting for a while in front of Keypoint when I walked by and then I happened to see you again at the Safeway entrance . I said hi but wish I could have thought of something more and interesting to say ... I was the guy with brown hair and beige shirt . You looked friendly , I would n't mind having a longer conversation : - ) Love , R. He moves his hips to the side a little bit and allows her knees room for leverage . She pulls her t-shirt up and over her head . Catching her hair , it falls behind her as she reaches to unhook her bra . The candlelight plays in images across her round breasts and flaccid nipples . She leans forward , placing one nipple to his wet lips as she pulls her pants off . First with one arm , then the other , she works the fabric down from her ankles until she is lying completely atop of him in nothing but cotton panties . He loves her creamy white skin and blinks hard to catch glimpses of her curves in the dim lighting . We met up at a study today , i thought you were pretty cute , you were awfully talkative and always seemed to have something to say . I would like to hang out , just chill and shit . You seem like you 'd make a cool friend Hey , Last night ( Tuesday , 5/26 ) , in the evening , we both were in the back-room on a mini platform watching the other guys going at it . Then , two guys came up to us , blew us and all eyes were on us . I noticed that you were the same guy when we both checked in at the same time ( I was behind you waiting for my turn to check in ) . You 're cute and I wished we could have done more together.. Perhaps again next time ? Tell me what I was wearing or what were you wearing when we checked in , so I know it 's you . Hope to hear from you . Hello ladies , I 'm a handsome man who loves to pleassure women . I am sweet and kind , someone who loves to give and make women happy . I have been recently tested and am DDF . I also have had a vasectomy . I would like you to also be DDF . We picked you up last and dropped me off first . We chatted about our careers and how mine could benifet yours . We takes politics and a little of our personal lives . Would love to reconnect . Let me know what ur career was and of course you 're name ; ) Xx Look what this girl done did to me She done cut me off from a good , good love She told me that those days were gone Gone , gone Now I 'm sitting here goin ' half crazy 'Cause I know she still thinks about me , too And it ai n't no way in hell That I can be just friends with you ... ... ... ... ... .. And I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends ... .no The way it felt , no fakin ' it Maybe we were movin ' just a little too fast But what we 've done , we ca n't take it back Back , back ... no Now I 'm sitting here halfway crazy 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too And it ai n't no way in hell That I can be just friends with you ... ..no And I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends Ai n't no tellin ' what we could 've been Ai n't no tellin ' what we could 've been , ... . no And if I knew it end like this I never would 've kissed ya 'Cause I fell in love with ya We never would 've kicked it Girl , now everything 's different I lost my only lover and my friend That 's why I wish we never did it And I wish we never loved it And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you And now it ai n't no way we can be friends ... ... ... ... ... .. Today , I was buying some stuff and I saw you girl walking on the same aisle , you were talking on the phone as you passed behind me I wanted to say you had beautiful eyes , but I reacted kind of slow . I was the latino construction guy wearing a cap . Man you were cute , I walked around the store and I did n't saw you anymore you were gone . In the unlikely event that you see this ad contact me , I want to tell you and not keep it inside me : ) . I can tell you what you were wearing , just to be sure it 's you . Two years later . Well almost three . I ca n't forget you . I know you 're living in sin with her , and she 'll bankrupt you into having a baby . You did n't want complications so it 's ironic you are catering to her wanting a baby . It will get old . Then you will cheat on her like you did with me , with your wife , with every girl that has crossed your path . Cheaters do n't change , but I still care about you . I still am in love with you . I keep wondering how you are . If you ever find yourself lonely ( and you will , trust me ) and need someone , I 'm here . I will always be waiting for you . my friends joke around with me , refer to you as my boyfriend . my crush is so big and obvious . if i did n't have scruples i 'd try to make something happen . but we 're both married with kiddos so it will never be . too sticky . plus you seem much too noble to ever even go there . i like that about you but at the same time it makes me want defile you all night long ... . you 're the hottest dad around though . i just had to get it outta my head . mc seems like the most appropriate place to do that . Smooth Latino bottom in room 204 . You had the nicest bubble butt I ever fucked . I have never licked a men 's ass but I want to like yours . Tell me who did I tell you I was imagining you being ? Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance , Saturday , May 23 , Wischemann Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect .

Or I could wait for the next divorce in a few years ? What do you say ? lets do this ! ! ! I love Logos books . I love the layout , the selection , the extensive photography collection . And yesterday I realized , that there 's something else that I like about Logos as well . You 're about 6 ' 1 - I 'd guess b/c I 'm 6 ' and you look a little taller - w long dark hair in a center part that comes down past your shoulders and you wear studious sort of glasses . Yesterday you had on jeans and a button down . You look close to my age ( I 'm 31 ) and you 've got a lean , cowboy kind of build , but look like the kind of guy who goes home to Thelonious Monk and Thomas Pynchon . I think you 've worked at Logos for some years now - 3 ? - but yesterday when you guided me to Dark Sun the history of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes I felt a little flutter in my heart that had nothing to do with nuclear energy. I do n't live in Santa Cruz ( Oakland is my home ) but if I did , I 'd come up with a lot more books for you to help me find . I 'm usually in SC once a month . And you might not be the kind of guy that 's into guys . But I am . And if you are too , I 'd love to buy you coffee sometime . Or even if you 're hetero , I know we both love books , so we 'll still have something to talk about . : ) We are a team of elite movers and shakers in Tech . We were in contact with the most excellent problem solver and reframer in the history of mankind but lost her email . Can you help us ? She just looks amazing in those boots and that 's definitely why we messed up -- it 's a scientific fact that our brains do n't work . All we remember is that she is HOT and a GODDESS but ca n't fill in any other freakin ' details ! ! ! ! Please help us ... .. you will know when you run into her because you will think she is incompetent I 'm missing you , my lovely shoreline park friend .

You are in SF area and saw my profile on Ashley Madison . I knew you 'll search here for me . Let 's connect ; - ) At least you said you were . You know who you are . Are you still out there playing ? I did not think it would be this hard to have no contact with you. Please let me know how things are going for you . I hope you are happy. Still love you. Your Lobster Exchanged some looks and smiles in Pegasus on Memorial Day ... .should have talked to you ? I was making fun of my friend and we all smiled . Well , email might work better . This could be for anyone . Or do you mean for the billion or so readers that we are all too late ? Not sure if you decided not to chat more , or if the temporary Craigslist email addresses expired. Either Way , could you get a hold of me so I know ? Dennis I asked how mans sets you had left . You are very sexy and I 'd like to get together . If you see this and are interested , let me know what machine and how many set you had . The happiest place on earth was inside your heart and especially inside your mouth , vagina and anus - you hot Pinay . I should have married you . You are a voluptuous white woman wearing jeans and red tshirt that said `` Application ? Driving a gray color mini truck. Me white man pumping gas at booth island. You are probably taken , but if not where do I fill out that application ? I got it bad for you . I should have approached you but I saw movement in the front seat so I held my ground . When you drove away , there was a nice looking brindle pit with you . I Wish I would have known . We 'd probably be talking right now . It 's been awhile and I lost your contact info . I would love to see you again . You work in Napa area and I work in Sebastopol area . If this is you , name the PARK we met at . It is a challenge to connect with a stranger during a crowded BART commute . This morning I wanted to say hi to you . I tried to do it with my eyes , but that was n't quite enough. You have a nice open face . You got off at Montgomery at about 9:20 . Black pants , black boots to your knee , black blazer , black and white stripped shirt . What was distinctive ? The stud earring in your upper left ear . I was wearing a green shirt with a tie . We both are married and good friends ( you are good friend of my wife ) . We both know that we want each other but could n't say it openly ( though you mentioned in a party on the weekend that you have hearts for me ... you were drunk ) . You are petite and I am tall Indian guy . We both think a like and very practical . I badly want you ... you have no idea how many times I fantasized about you . Will you we able to keep it a secret and enjoy ? Hope you see this and reply back . I am N and you are M. We passed each other outside the doors at Palace Art & amp ; Supply in Capitola on Monday afternoon . You were super cute , black hair , nose ring , jeans , etc , and scowling , I was scowling too . Mine was for my current project sapping the life force out of me , which is why I fumbled until you had passed . Maybe yours was for a similar art project or at the bright sun , or at me . Maybe we can inspire each other . Maybe we can go get supplies at the same time next week ? Moving his hand from her face , he caresses her long hair . Taking the lightest dark locks in between his fingers , he twirls these parts of her fast until they pull taut and fall back to her shoulders . He enjoys this game , pulling her to him in these small bits until , slightly tortured , she falls back to her own side . He touches her soft cheek , hoping that touch will suffice for words until he has time to think things through . She smiles , happily accepting the affectionate gesture from her new lover . The brightness in her eyes takes him almost by surprise . She never seems to smile anymore . `` Dammit , he tells himself , `` Kiss her , hug her or something . . . . Either response would be too simple to explain the complexity of emotions he feels for her . She yields to his desire , turning her head to the other side and exposing her untouched skin . Deliberately , he runs the flat of his wet tongue over the salt of her neck . He does n't bite yet , but moves over her until she lies flat on top of the lumped up bed covers . From this pinned position , she comes alive . Moving only her hands , she manages to pull his t-shirt out of his belt and half way up over his back . She runs her tiny hands over the warmed , exposed skin and kisses him with a passion incomparable to that of his deviant biting . Her strong thighs wrap around his waist , pulling him to her in one swift surge . Whatever her doubts and insecurities were , she finds no solace in her concerns . Rather , she rolls over with him until she is in a half sitting position on top of his clothed body . Ravenously , she kisses him with vengeance until the saliva from within her cheeks drips easily from his slick lips . To the super cute woman I bumped into twice at two places in 10 mins , I was thoroughly charmed and I am now painfully bewitched ... Wanted to ask you to lunch but was too late in the parking lot ... . Write to me , you cutie : ) This seldom happens to me , but man it did today ! You rang me up this afternoon at ACE Hardware in Sebastopol . I saw a quick glimpse of your eyes during a typical friendly exchange at first , and could n't believe what I saw. No ... ..could n't be ... ... . But it so was true ! The biggest hazel deep green , sparkly , fantastically incredible gorgeous eyes I 've even seen ! We looked at each other as I gave you some cash , I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the money thing . Then you gave me change , I think I may have said have a great afternoon , but I locked onto , and into those perfectly clear pools of hypnotic green for what seemed like minutes ! And heres the part that seldom happens to me , they stayed with me all day and into the evening ! Like I had just left you moments ago ! I could so look at those eyes again ! Thank you ! Crossed paths at the Mexican market there Miller Ave. on Monday I think . I was next in line behind you . Would like to sit and have coffee with you , my treat . You were also wearing a black tank top . I was in the vehicle with writing on it . Sat across from you and your friend at Starbucks Monday morning . You : tall , tight gray shorts ... I 'm guessing from San Francisco . Saw you again Tuesday morning . Hit me up . We sat next to each other at the bar and talked a little bit . We made a bet on the warriors game . I thought you were really attractive , but I did n't get your number . If you see this , let me know the details of our bet ! Long shot , but we played for a few minutes at the Jacks party last night . We were both in the lobby afterwards . As you were leaving , I think you said `` Thanks for letting me join . You looked like someone I knew from Atlanta . If that was you ... would love to get in touch . Ellen we bought your Suburu Blue wagon around 4 month 's ago ?

She holds his hand by the tips of his fingers and enjoys feeling the familiar bend in his hand as he lights candles with his other hand . Fumbling , he places the candle atop the desk and moves her to his bed. She sits , patiently attentive to her thoughts , on top of the jumbled bed clothes and watches him take off his shoes with delicate balance . Holding her face , he kisses her on both cheeks before removing her glasses and placing them on the nightstand . The kisses feel good to her and she enjoys the warm breath on her goospimpled skin . Again , he kisses her softly on the face as he moves his stubbled framed mouth to her smooth lips . She pulls back slightly , startled at the roughness of his three day beard , but resumes relaxation as his kisses move from her mouth to her neck . I asked you for a light you told me the night before you drank way too much I told you how to cure that. Your BF is a bartender. I saw you glancing after we talked outside. I was looking too. I 'll have to have more dreams about `` what if ... How do i ask u to ? How do I suppress my selfish need to explore other sexual experiences while wanting u all to myself . I want to make out and cuddle with her then come home and fall deeper in love with u. I need a reboot once in a while from a real throbbing penis , but have no desire to commit to a man . We have been through so much and when my dying day comes I wanthyou holding my hand , raising our children . I 'm asking u to be stronger than me , I 'm askingbyou to let me wander while you stay faithful to me ! She gently tosses her head to one side and the dim light catches under her eyes in what almost seems to be a leery , ominous glow of intensity . He ca n't tell if she is still smiling because her face is tilted slightly to one side , but he can hear her unsure , off rhythm breath clearly . `` Come on he says , gently pulling her up from her knees . He knows he 's taking a chance with her since he 's not quite sure where they stand , but the moment is too much for him to ignore . She stands slowly , not quite sure what she thinks of the situation -- of him -- but follows him into the bedroom . and wonder is he looking at at it too ? Will he return your text if you contacted him ? What would he say if you showed up at his door ? You miss at how his hugs and caresses melted your problems away even if it was for a few days. You miss at how his flirting , laughter made you smile , laugh and brought you joy. You miss at how he magically would make the darkness disappear for a while. You miss at how his passionate kisses would make your toes curl. Then you realize , the reason he is not there still exists. He wanted more than you were willing to give. He was unwilling to accept less than he wanted. He was tired of being pushed away every time you felt the need to run away. He was tired of being the one you called only when you felt abandoned by others. You do not miss that he easily brought you sadness when he pushed back as you push him away. Sometimes events , people remind him of you like someone did last night . Sometimes events , people remind you of him . Sometimes you just want to snuggle up to him one last time , see if the fire and passion are in his kisses ... Looking for another sister CD to live with in santa rosa as a roommate.

SEND e-mail with pic so we can start this. Room is ready 6-1-15. You were by yourself , leaving as I was going in . You definitely looked at me and smiled , I thought you were very pretty and would like to say `` Hi and get to know you . I am older . I did n't mean to be rude by walking by without saying anything . You looked nervous , really pretty but nervous . I wanted to say something but I get it . Well I do n't understand any of it but I 'm not trying to come at you if you do n't want me to . I still hope you would hit me up . Hey today I walked in and ordered a drink . You were the cute cashier . With curly brownish hair and a cute smile . I thought you were hot . starbucks on capitol expressway and McLaughlin . were both the same age it was around 11.20 . You were a cute , fun loving woman dancing samba by the water ; ) . You can shake ! Was torn between watching your sensual moves or your radiant smile when you danced . You were there with friends . We smiled , we talked after the event . I wanted to dance with you later that night but you had someone. We share a mutual acquaintance , used to live in the same city , enjoyed a witty quick conversation that ended too soon. Long shot , but hey better than not trying . Christine , I 've thought about you a lot over the years and I think we really could have made a great couple . Do you believe in second chances ? We could be great together . -T Last saw you a couple of weeks ago . We were supposed to hang out again . Where did you disappear to ? You seemed like a great gal who loves the outdoors , we talked for a minute and then continued on . I think we met on Rough Go . Woe to me for not saying more ! But now I am asking , would you like to meet again , for a hike , or a drink , or both ? : ) You introduced yourself as Crystal and partnered with me at the ballroom dance lessons , and you showed me how to Waltz . I was n't planning to go to the Ball but I went in hopes of seeing you again . We danced even though I did n't know how to dance , and I told you that I was really only there so I would have a chance to dance with you again . I realized afterwards that was a mistake because of how awkward it made things . I 'm sorry I made you so uncomfortable . I hope you still had a great rest of the night , and that you find someone who treats you right because I think you are very special . Hi Corey. You were at the Cafe with friends . I was looking at the apartment ads when you were out having a cigarette . this was about 830pm . Should have given you my phone number then . Lets meet up ! Just tell me where you live , so I know it is you . I exist now dreaming in reality , shades of deep reds and grays , Evolving at the speed of light As my third eye sees all , I bring my fingers to my lips and time stops I taste you. I ponder you and wallow in the memory of your scent and way. How you called me baby The way you made me laugh The way you touched my heart and made me believe Unable to stop , it seems too wonderful , but in the end there is not much but pain. I allow this for some time , then I awake and know that I am alive and the possibilities are endless. Wanting you to taste my soul and undeniably know that I am the one and we are one to conquer happiness together , unimaginably , the way you knew that we could and will if you say one word , Yes ! Your fear . Your ego . Your pride . They protect and also hurt you , keeping you from what is rightfully yours , Love. If I had your heart again ? Oh , the way I would touch it , nurture it and protect it My most sacred gift God wants what I want , he trusts me and knows my light is pure as he does you. Say the word once. The heavens will open up and the angels will sing in our praise Because we chose. Please do n't be afraid , I am always here for you. I 'LL MISS YOU IM LEAVING THE U.S .

I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE TO MEET A PERSON AND START A FRIENDSHIP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GOES FROM THERE . Saw you on the bench reading and picking your nose . I walked by several times to get your attention but you seemed preoccupied with the nose thing . I had on grey shorts and tennies . Tell me where the bench was to make sure it 's you . I left work because you freed me from it . I had it all along - you ! My knowledge -- & gt ; wisdom -- & gt ; success w/o you ? = uncertainty You : I love you. Me : I love you more.

You are so beautiful Hispanic woman with black or brown curly hair and a lovely smile I was breathtaking . I did n't have time to say something and I did n't want to get you in to trouble . But I enjoyed locking eyes and smile with you . If you see this I would like to get together and go for coffee or Ice cream together or something . I miss the way you closed your eyes when I kissed you. I wish I could kiss you again . Wow , I did n't think anything about meeting someone at the drive thru , then I got to the window , we shared a little bit , and then I left . I have n't stopped thinking about you , I think we had a connection . I you feel the same message me back , put the name of the restaurant in the subject line , hope to hear from you soon . As I was leaving the farmers market , you were getting out of your car and then getting stuff out of the passenger 's side . You were wearing these navy yoga pants , and you were arcing your back and bending your hips in just such a way ... well , I could n't not stare . And I know you caught me staring ( off the reflection on your car ) . So - first , sorry for staring . Second , if it 's not weird to say , thank you . Your butt was the highlight of my day . Absolutely incredible ; ) If you write , tell me what color and make your car is. I posted here in a time of weakness and pain . You used it as an opportunity to judge me and browbeat me with your evangelical Christian brainwashing . You judged me as being in pain because I needed Jesus . You are dangerously misinformed about your own outer religion . when I responded to thank you but point out Mathhew 6:5 - do n't be like the hypocrites - and the Book of Job - bad things happen to great people and you should n't judge - you flew into a rage . This has happened three other times that I 've posted here . I did not ask for help or to be evangelized . I was merely telling my story . You use Jesus to aggrandize your own ego . I 'm literally thinking every day of killing myself and you are out there trying to make me feel even worse about myself through your idea of religion . You get a good feeling out of telling other people you are holier than they are when they are down . You are just awful . I should be free FROM your religion . Hey We chatted at the bar , your name was Hannah and you said you teach in San Mateo . I wish I had asked you out , but you left ... .. You were going to see Dior and I , I was in the lobby waiting for friends . We smiled and said hello . Would love to meet you . We could not keep our eyes from eachother ... You in your black leather jacket and kids , me in black shirt and jeans . I tried to figure out a way to come introduce myself but you seemed to be with your family ! You 'll never see this I 'm sure but just for fun You were in the yellow muscle shirt . I was staring and admiring your beautiful , large hard pecs . You smiled big at me , and I got embarrassed . I 'm working on that -- should have said hi . Hi ? We met on the beach with our dogs . I told you I loved red hair . When you told me you were a high school teacher I told you the boys must be hot for you . You said you were stressed from finals . I can help . We can go to nude beach and be totally free and relaxed then my place where I have massage table for a sensual full body massage then I would give you totally oral bliss . And that just the beginning BABY , I AM SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW I TREATED YOU.LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS NO GOOD , YOUR MY SUNSHINE , MY BABY GIRL .I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AND START NEW ! I COULD TYPE FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT I WISH OR WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD RATHER BE LOOKING INTO YOUR SEXY BROWN EYES AND TELLING YOU INPERSON ... .THIS SUCKS BABY : I NEED YOU , WANT YOU , MISS YOU ! GIVE ME A CHANCE AND HEAR ME OUT , PLEASE ... ... IF YOU READ THIS , CALL ME SO WE CAN TALK , PLEASE ! OR EMAIL ME ! SO I KNOW ITS YOU , WERE WAS OUR FIRST KISS ? ? ? ? ? ? Ps ... ... i love you baby ! Leoncio Navarro i really want to see you . If your attached or not . Please find me . T I have moments in my day when I think about us . I do n't cry anymore , sigh at times and maybe clear my throat , but it 's not at all like the first time . I have realized that the greatest gift you gave me was the lesson in loving myself and realizing my worth . It may have come at a cost , because in that very process I learned that our failures were not worth carrying around but rather to be placed under my feet and used as stepping stones to something better. I ca n't begin to tell you how many times I have ended something with someone simply because your voice echoes in my head `` you are better than that , you deserve more I always credit you for my change of behavior and even though it makes me want to scream at times , I am most pleased with the outcome : - ) your love paved the way to a healthier me and I needed you to know that it was not all for nothing ! In some attempts , it is glorious even to fail I saw you in Carls Jr in Martinez SATURDAY about 6 or 7pm . You were with another girl & amp ; some young dude . You had pushed a baby stroller to your table . When I first saw you , I was so hooked . I could n't take my eyes off you . I left a note for you to find , I pray . Then when I drove away , past the window where you were sitting , ... you and the other chick were totally staring at me , & amp ; both of you were waving at me .

CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME ! So , you were at 90 's night tonight and you were by far the coolest human there . Your moves were solid across the board , and you were clearly there for the music , not to hook up , which is why I Ieft you way the hell alone ( also : social anxiety ) . BUT ( and this is a big but ) , it maybe seemed like you could be could be interested , or maybe I am totally off base . You were present , but , like , never actively pursuing , so it 's hard to tell . Anyway , um , you had light jeans on and a tight black top that really highlighted your quite exquisite back . I was just , you know , a white human , black shirt , basically the most boring thing ever . But I promise I am at least a little cool , if you did want to reach out . K. Good night . Too weak and tired to write much tonight ; why is my muse not bringing me coffee and rolling me with a rolling pin ? It 's in the job description . Anyhow , this is the best I can do tonight , despite all the beautiful women in the world ... : -/ The nIght of the hot red things I 've seen big cafeterias And vaulted marble ceilings , I 've seen dark things mysterious And people with no feelings I 've seen bright fields of roses And golden onion domes , I 've seen misshapen noses , And brand new mobile homes I 've seen two tits to die for , And Martin Luther King , I 've seen San Bernardino , And damn near everything ! But something that I 'm missing Which it seems I need to see , Is a year or two of kissing you , In the third degree ! Three More Bloody Haikuses Not infrequently I feel like I will die Love is a life boat Thinking of your face At times when you look happy Helps me to survive Following one 's heart Leads one through flaming canyons And down to the beach If I need you more than I want you ...

Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance tonight , Saturday , May 23 , Wischelman Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect . I 'm looking for a cute , sweet and drop-dead gorgeous girl whose name is Dulce who was a manager at a Carl 's Jrs at 1999 Camden Ave ( San Jose , CA ) with Marylou . Dulce speaks Spanish as well. I do n't want to flirt nor date . I just want to say hi and know how is she doing. Hi , Dulce . You worked at Carls Jrs ( Union and Camden ) I ate there almost every weekend since November 2012 till December 2013. Dulce , you probably remember me . You sighed virtually every time you saw me . How are you ? You were upstairs having a drink with your friends sitting on a stool overlooking the drunk dancers . You wore glasses and a white top and I could just tell you had a good vibe to you . Would love to get to know you better . You came in looking for a restroom..Then came back with a smile to update me..I wish we had just a minute longer I 'm wondering if you saw me ? I thought maybe you were looking into my eyes , because I Was looking into yours . I was inside and you were walking by with a friend . I looked thru the window and between the fence , you were wearing black fitness pants with a yellowish top and a Scarlett scarf/headband . If you saw me ? Let me know . Never thought I 'd see my girl til I saw you tonight . You were at the corner of 23rd and Castro making a left , listening to Pac and smoking a cigarette . You stopped me in my tracks and I could n't look away . I was walking up 23rd backwards looking at you take a drag off that smoke while you made the left . Silver Hyundai . How many girls listen to Pac rolling around by themselves ? If you saw me let me know and tell me what I was wearing . If you see this and you do n't wan na reach out I just got ta say keep doin you , it looks like it 's working . You know no one does it it like you . When I was sad , I let myself be sad . Well I guess it 's time to be happy . You fill my dreams and nightmares . Let me taste you , my longing for you as I grip my knees on either side of you . Let me make it up to you . I wish the best for you . I was really good to you . I just love your secret smile . I do n't think I 'll post here again . I 'm in a place of peace and hope . I am even more puzzled , than hurt . It 's a real shame too . It 's just something I 'd do for you . Hear me moan as you take a fist of my hair in one hand my flesh in the other . Have a nice life . Have a great weekend ! Be kind to me . As I said , there is someone waiting for me out there . All the love I felt but could n't express . All pain and nothing about it . Accept it and cherish it . Sat for an hour and a half trying to work up to go in and ask you out . I do n't think you 've realized it but every single time ive walked into your jobs , this and the one before and unless im mistaken theres one that was before that but I just liked to go and kinda check you out , its been with the intent to ask you out on a date . I really suck at it . I see you almost daily at World Gym and we exchange smiles every now and then . I wish I can say more or be any more descriptive , but if I did I 'll reveal who you are . If you think it is you that I am talking about , send me an email with what you were wearing at the gym today . Hi Cutie , You were sitting next to me at a stop light and you reached back to roll the window down so your son could say hi to me. HMU -- let 's chat . We had some hot fun a month or two again and I 'd love to feed you my cock again . I loved your submissive and how you too my thick cock Respond back with what we did and how you look so I know its you Hope to hear from you ; I donthave grindr anymore so lost contact I hope , I hope you see this . I was sitting at the window counter sipping an iced tea and reading . You were in line and then you sat next to me while you waited for your drink . I could n't think of anything to say but what I wanted to say was . `` hi , I love you hair Cute boots. You look to be about 50-55 grey hair , stocky build ... .you were wearing nice blue plaid type shirt and had your face buried in the paper . We exchanged glances a few times I thought you were very nice looking , any way if you are into guys and remember my greeting , say hello and see where this nice bottom guy can take you ... . If the stars align perhaps we can meet again ... ... . Damn this short attention span I was perfectly content on my island , but you came in like a monsoon , sucking me out to sea . Floating in the warmth of your intentions . The calm winds began to change , sputtering gusts at first . Tropical blasts battered followed by arctic chills sending me so off course there was no hope of finding my way back . Now I 'm left adrift , watching the compass spin , knowing that the next rush will be the final blow that drowns me . Please just put me back where you found me . Good looking tall black guy wearing scrubs and a jacket . Made eye contact several times . Discreet professional white guy here standing across from you . Would love to connect if you see this . Let me know what was on your jacket so I know it 's you . I know I probably enjoyed that just as much , if not more than you . i wanted to add a few sweet little kisses in here and there on your neck and shoulder area but it would have been a little bit improper.i hope you take me up on my offer , a little bit of privacy and better setting will make a world 's difference . i promise to remain a complete gentleman the entire time and respect any limitations you may have.just keep in mind im willing to go the extra mile ... ... . Just wondering how many women have been left in the wake of your desires ? How many times have you walked the line of improper with promises of respect and being a gentleman ? Do you really know what going the extra mile means ? Does the road trip end when you get to add those `` sweet kisses or to quite when it gets real ?

Each day I get on BART , I see you when you get on at Orinda before we head into the tunnel towards SF , you stand right by the door , heading I know not where , I 'd like to be able to say something to you , even a hi , but I 'm too shy to . I 'm the one with the bike and the bike clothes , sitting there in the seat wishing I could just say something , but then Embarcadero comes and I have to get off because I 'm going to work , flying around the city , delivering goods . I would love to actually get to talk to you , but this biker is very shy . I do n't know if you 'll be there the next time I ride and each time I can only hope . Please be that Hope . you just got to your parked car and I was walking by.. you put your backpack in the trunk , put money in the meter and then passed me.. when you walked towards me you said `` helllo.. or how are you I said hello back . I watched you walk down the street . man.. you are so handsome . In the unlikely event that you see this.. email me so we can meet for coffee sometime . Hello there , you like being outdoors and hiking on trails and need a new friend to talk to , I am a working guy who would like to meet another easygoing person to get to know better and have some hiking fun on the weekends . I am looking for relationship and love ... . You Latin looking bear with that hot beard hanging around at closing . Me stocky masculine bearded white linebacker who wanted to seriously put your legs over my shoulders and make you beg . This is a long shot but if you are out there reading this and interested HMU. Tell me what it is about your beard that is different so I know it 's you . 24 Hour Fitness , SuperSport on Crane To the cute girl with glasses jogging around between sets , I 'm glad you took an extra lap by me as I was finishing up . Definitely gave me something to remember this weekend. Not my usual gym or workout time , but maybe I 'll see you around I wanted to pullover to talk to you . You are VERY sexy . If this is you , and you 're interested , please reply and tell me what my vehicle was so I know it was you . I just wanted to say thank you for your compassion . My girlfriend and I were there with our dog who we ended up having to let go . From the exam room I heard the tech apologizing for the wait and could hear you saying it was no problem , that you understood ... I would like to think that most people in your shoes would feel the same way , but working in a veterinary hospital myself , I know that people can be amazingly insensitive and selfish when made to wait under similar circumstances . So thank you so much for your kindness , patience , and compassion . I hope your dog is okay , he was really cute and under any other circumstances I would have given him all the attention he seemed to want from us ! Take care , and please know that your small kindness made a big difference to us on that very painful night . As I came out of Trader Joes you were there with your children and you looked at me like you knew me and you said Hi and you took my breath you were so beautiful . I am pretty sure I said Hi back but I walked straight to my car . OMG you were so beautiful and I ca n't shake that feeling that you must know me . as God is my witness , love will prevail . I have you in my sights , and , to quote our nasal friend Mr. Declan P. MacManus , `` My aim is true ! `` C. x S. I had suitcases , you had ( blank ) . Very sexy eyes , gave me great thoughts through the day ... . You- Beauty in a light blue suv. Me- Red shirt , white truck. I should n't have gotten off at my exit ... You had no makeup on , white shirt with black yoga pants . You have a beautiful face . I was by you on bart with a grey sweatshirt . Lets talk ... .email me and tell me its you by saying what oakland stop you got off at ... . I know this is a long shot but you were wearing a north face coat earlier this week . I saw you by bart , you had glasses on . This is to just say hi and maybe become friends , nothing else , you look like you have a lot on your mind and could use a person to talk to . I dont have any ill intentions just friends . I am a man and would respect any situation your in . I saw this couple near Mission/15th and the male was being very aggressive and looked like he was about to be abusive . I 'd really like to know whether this was a school experiment to see what passersby would say . It freaked me out and I 'd like to ease my mind . ( I did yell at him that I 'd taken his picture so he better not hurt her but I had kids in the car so I felt I could n't do more . ) You look fancy in that somewhat short green skirt . You got good legs and an attractive look and physique . I got into pumping gas seeing you were pumping gas in the pump near De Anza Park : ) Seems you noticed I looked at you - may be not , could not be sure. You are pretty. I 've seen you while riding my bike down Shattuck while you wait for the 18 . I have seen you a few times on the 18 towards Albany/Solano , also . You usually get on somewhere around Alcatraz , I think , sometimes on Ashby. We 've smiled at each other pleasantly , though I 've always wanted to strike up a conversation with you , despite you wearing headphones ( and I recognize that 's maybe the point of wearing them and I do not fault you for wanting to be left alone on public transit ) . I 'm a tall , bearded , glasses-wearing goober who is often reading or slipping back and forth between awake and asleep thanks to the early hour and the warm bus ride . I think we 'd get along , though I ca n't really say why. Would you be interested in getting a pint or a tumbler or a cuppa something sometime ? I would relish the opportunity to get to know you better . Hi , Beautiful girl who was sitting next to me on IHSS Orientation at 1 pm today . You left your SS card in the car . Please get back to me if you read this. Greg Easily the prettiest/hottest/sexiest woman I think I have ever seen ! Seriously . Super model style . Anyone else notice how perfect that woman was ? Grey denim . Bun . Painted toes . Trying my best to be respectful. Anyways , made my day as I stood in that shitty line . So big thanks , to the brunette who , I 'm assuming is a model . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . * I do n't take much shit from ladies , *even the sexy/hot girls . EVER . I would let this woman walk all over me like a loser . Actually I would n't . But some dude is a lucky S.O.B. This is whats up to that cute ass asian working out at the Fremont 24 by Bart around the noon time . Just saying whats up tho . I have n't seen you in so long . I 've made too many mistakes to make it right . I hope you 're doing well . I love you ... forever I 'm lost for words . Yes , me . I know it took a lot for you to do that . Thank you but just know that I 'm trying to make `` sense of it . Even though I do n't think `` sense has anything to do with this ( smile ) . I will admit , you scare me a little bit , but in a good way . Please be patient with me , I do n't know what to do and that is the truth. I was the gent that waved to you and thought that you were so wonderful ! I am hoping if you are single that you would go out with me for a coffee date ? If interested let me know ok ... ... . sincerely me ... . You get me off the equipment I was using so you could complete your routine I would love to get to know you better and i wish you end up reading this Tell me which equipment I was using I 'm looking to find and reconnect with you , we met and went on a couple dates . You were really nice and pretty . Curvy , had a nose ring , pretty short hair from what I remember and tattoos . Things ended but I wish they did n't . Please reply . You 've recently worked with my family putting in a sport court . I 'm not really the type to post something like this but you 've been on my mind ever since you came by to show us your tiles . I 've heard through the grapevine that your a divorced dad of one . Is there any chance you 'd be interested in a divorced mom of one ? I 'm secure , sane , and your sense of humor is right up my ally . I hope I hear back . I 'm mixed black and white , short hair , glasses and beard You said your name was _hil , ''like Phil , but with a _ . and that you were headed to Temescal to meet with some friends. You were kind of tall and handsome and had a very mellow and confident demeanor and you had a skirt on . I said I smoked too much weed .

Thanks for letting me know I almost forgot my plant ! Coffee sometime ? ... that after three grueling years I may have finally turned the corner health-wise . A misread MRI and a therapist who knows the correct course of treatment give me hope where there was none . So this is a good chance to thank you for the support you have given me in your own special way . It 's been nothing short of astonishing ... I literally do n't know how I would have survived without you . I truly do n't know where your heart lies , I think you can feel my confusion when I go off on one of my jackass rifts ... if it 's with someone else , that makes your support of me even more amazing . You are an angel , one sent here to help me through my darkest hour and if I can ever do anything for you all you need do is pick up the phone . Whoever you love is the luckiest person on the face of this earth and should never take that for granted . xxoo Met you at the bar , I only stayed for a quick beer.. You are from PA and here on business . I wanted to buy you a drink but I was in a hurry . Maybe we can meet up for a drink when you 're back in the area ?

You were at the cash machine on Thursday morning around 8:30 AM . You had your hair colored red . Something about your simplicity and your naturalness really got me staring at you , was shy to approach you as I thought you might not be interested in a 40 year old guy . If you see this , hope you respond back . Love your personality and overall rad vibe. I 'd love to get to know you better. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. I 've seen you a couple times and I 'm amazed by you tall gorgeous smile . I think you noticed me checking you out.Never posted on here but I 'm shy and a bit intimidated . Doubt you 'll see this but if you do please say hi . You are and older yet fit white man . You are always wearing black or gray sleeveless shirts and shorts . We always make eye contact when you are on a stationary bike in the front . You are on there all the time before you work out and post workout . I overheard someone call you and your name is john . Super sexy man . I also saw you driving off in a BMW . We locked eyes and smiled to each other on BART . You even looked back when you got off at Montgomery Street . I tried to find you but got lost in the shuffle . I walked around the block and even went to Starbucks , just for a chance to say hi. Me : Young guy in a yellow/gray hoodie. You : Beautiful brunette in a slim-fitting dress with black leggings and red lipstick. I felt something this morning . If you did too , please respond . This is uncharacteristic but ca n't get you out of my head so figured I give this a shot. It was last Saturday . I stopped into Rite Aid . You were working the register closest to the door. A beautiful brunette with glasses . You said hello , I said it back . I grabbed what I needed and stood in line . We made eye contact a few times while waiting . Maybe you thought I was suspicious , maybe something else . I ended up at the other register . We made eye contact again . On my way out I said goodbye and you responded back. I 'm not sure what your situation is but I ca n't shake you. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile . Please message me back if there is something real or it was all in my head J Mathilda says hi . Too bad you 've been banned my friend . I just hope you did n't get wasted on coconut water to compensate ... Wow you are super cute ! I could n't stop staring at you as you walked through the cross . I gave a smile you gave one back and then , , , I noticed your bum and you looked back and caught me , guess i was n't to discrete . I hope I did n't creep you out , sorry , but you are adorable . I hope you see this and know I 'm gon na be day dreaming about you and your amazing body , probably for the rest of the week. Thanks for walking in front of my truck ! Sorry for the misunderstanding . I have good intentions ... just asking for peace nothing more . Hope I did n't offend you . Have a nice day . : - ) This post was a fine post , in addition I think it should be added that often enough a relationship can become so strained that one or both parties decide that the relationship is beyond an ability to reconcile . We 're all grown ups though , we all know that . While I believe in mutual understanding , understandably it 's a well that can go dry . Like anything if you do n't take care of the things you have , you ca n't expect to keep it . Honesty is probably a key factor . Responsibility for ones actions another in reconciliation. I like this topic I see you all the time , and love your smiles and your sexy outfits.Always look forward to seeing you cross paths with me.If your interest is piqued , respond to this and I will share some more details . Mostly old white dudes here but I 've spotted a few hotties recently . I 'm a swimmer and usually hit the pool when I 'm there . Anyone looking for a workout partner ? You : Doe , stacks , white , ultra cool and easygoing . Blatino PS . We talked about Dwinelle and other things while people were heading to the sling area to fuck . My ride was leaving and I had to leave the desert . We never exchanged # s. Are you as curious as I am ? Let me know what dept you work in and a little about me ... and if you want to continue . i see you there when i work out in early afternoon . brown hair , nice , nice infrastructure ; i would n't be surprised if maybe you were south american with euro thrown in. me , s/p bearded , fit , lean guy with blue orbs You seemed to be an attendant to a nice older lady in a wheelchair . While we were waiting in the radiology area , you kept stretching and yawning and saying `` Good Night , at 1100am . You are very attractive , in my eyes , and I would like to spend some time with you . I was wearing glasses and a short , trimmed beard and sitting a few seats behind you and to your left . Hi Sam , Hopefully this gets to her or someone she knows . I am a classmate of yours and I wanted to let you know I do have a print for you. I had to leave in rush because a friend who is in town and staying with me was at my front door and had to run back home. I realized I didnt give you my info so that once I made another print I could give it to you . Sorry I found a print that I did make and its yours for free Just contact me and its yours. take care : ) Hello , You were dancing to your music in your van this morning on the 101 freeway headed north . We flirted back and forth , and I loved your shy smile . I blew you a kiss and you caught it : ) I wish I could have said hello , but being on the freeway made that pretty impossible . I know this is a long shot , but was the best option i can think of to try to find you . If by chance you see this , I 'd love to hear from you . If you do write , please tell me what I was driving so I know it you . Here 's hoping ! D My presence exists only with you. Can you feel it now ? Could you feel me coming ? Did you retreat somewhere safer ? I would n't blame you . It 's terrifying here . I do n't know what 's more terrifying ... Be it the unfathomable extent to which life has changed ? Or the painfully beautiful memories I never even considered I could miss proving me wrong . A lifetime of memories ; compressed into a few distinct feelings : all equallyIntense , abrasive , soul piercing as one another . Ca n't shift my focus ... You overflow my mind , It 's splitting at the seams ; terrified of what it dreams The rain continues to fall Nostalgia prevails over all Will you notice me or look away ? Are you even there ? It 's time I take that breath and a plunger Hi , I met this wonderful lady on c-space ( a website ) but she has not logged in since our last conversation on 5/9 . She is 23 years old and 5'2 . She was born in Vietnam and came here 5 years ago . If this is you please log back in or , if you forgot your password , reply to this post . I really want to continue talking with you . Have a nice day ! : ) I met you in Berkley in the summer of 1973 . Your father was an Air Force pilot and you have connections to the Pacific Northwest . Please contact me , Joe You were the tall brunette with near perfect body that farted in the bread last night . I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked `` Was that you ? You quickly replied `` No it was n't me ! As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence , but it was evident . I tried to get rid of the stench by waving two loaves of Ciabetta bread . You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner . You 're beautiful and even if you were a liar and fart like a Clydesdale I 'd love to meet up . Friends recognize each others limits and value each other enough to not continuing to cross those metaphorical lines . Friends value each other 's truth and respect each other enough to at least not lie . Nothing is one sided , odds are in favor of both sides having a role in the play . But there is a scale of acceptable behavior . There does exist something that 's referred to as fair play . I tried to have patience and I was very forgiving . Even willing to take you back for a twice broken trust . You put me through hell . Should n't have wasted our time killing each other. I 'm all out of fight. Go and fuck with some other persons head . But make sure he 's stupid . Perhaps you think I have nothing better to do than write poems you are n't going to read ? Humph , and double-humph .

The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands .

You forgot your detergent and had to go back home around 6:45 . I was standing on the corner , waiting for my friend to arrive for dinner , when you walked by . He and I parted ways in the median around 8 and you passed by us -- back to the laundromat , earbuds in your ears , glasses on your nose , flip-flops on your feet -- walking in rhythm the whole time . You got on the F train this morning at about 8:30 AM with an older white gentleman . You had a star of David necklace on , a striped black and white shirt with some fitted jeans .

We made a comment or two , tell me about what . But I want to meet if you are out there reading . Why are you doing this ? Is it entertaining for you ? Do you feel it 's somehow deserved ? Because she 's hot , a goddess , then she deserves to be objectified and written off of a person lacking in substance , unworthy of respect , of love ?

We were waiting for our orders and chatted a little. You were wearing a maroon sweater , black leggings and light brown Uggs .

You looked friendly , I would n't mind having a longer conversation : - ) Love , R. He moves his hips to the side a little bit and allows her knees room for leverage . She pulls her t-shirt up and over her head . Catching her hair , it falls behind her as she reaches to unhook her bra . The candlelight plays in images across her round breasts and flaccid nipples . She leans forward , placing one nipple to his wet lips as she pulls her pants off . First with one arm , then the other , she works the fabric down from her ankles until she is lying completely atop of him in nothing but cotton panties . He loves her creamy white skin and blinks hard to catch glimpses of her curves in the dim lighting . We met up at a study today , i thought you were pretty cute , you were awfully talkative and always seemed to have something to say . I would like to hang out , just chill and shit . You seem like you 'd make a cool friend Hey , Last night ( Tuesday , 5/26 ) , in the evening , we both were in the back-room on a mini platform watching the other guys going at it . Then , two guys came up to us , blew us and all eyes were on us . I noticed that you were the same guy when we both checked in at the same time ( I was behind you waiting for my turn to check in ) .

You did n't want complications so it 's ironic you are catering to her wanting a baby . It will get old .

Are you still out there playing ? I did not think it would be this hard to have no contact with you. Please let me know how things are going for you . I hope you are happy. Still love you. Your Lobster Exchanged some looks and smiles in Pegasus on Memorial Day ... .should have talked to you ? I was making fun of my friend and we all smiled . Well , email might work better . This could be for anyone . Or do you mean for the billion or so readers that we are all too late ? Not sure if you decided not to chat more , or if the temporary Craigslist email addresses expired. Either Way , could you get a hold of me so I know ? Dennis I asked how mans sets you had left . You are very sexy and I 'd like to get together . If you see this and are interested , let me know what machine and how many set you had . The happiest place on earth was inside your heart and especially inside your mouth , vagina and anus - you hot Pinay . I should have married you . You are a voluptuous white woman wearing jeans and red tshirt that said `` Application ? Driving a gray color mini truck. Me white man pumping gas at booth island. You are probably taken , but if not where do I fill out that application ? I got it bad for you . I should have approached you but I saw movement in the front seat so I held my ground . When you drove away , there was a nice looking brindle pit with you . I Wish I would have known . We 'd probably be talking right now . It 's been awhile and I lost your contact info . I would love to see you again . You work in Napa area and I work in Sebastopol area . If this is you , name the PARK we met at . It is a challenge to connect with a stranger during a crowded BART commute . This morning I wanted to say hi to you . I tried to do it with my eyes , but that was n't quite enough. You have a nice open face . You got off at Montgomery at about 9:20 . Black pants , black boots to your knee , black blazer , black and white stripped shirt . What was distinctive ? The stud earring in your upper left ear . I was wearing a green shirt with a tie . We both are married and good friends ( you are good friend of my wife ) . We both know that we want each other but could n't say it openly ( though you mentioned in a party on the weekend that you have hearts for me ... you were drunk ) . You are petite and I am tall Indian guy . We both think a like and very practical . I badly want you ... you have no idea how many times I fantasized about you . Will you we able to keep it a secret and enjoy ? Hope you see this and reply back . I am N and you are M. We passed each other outside the doors at Palace Art & amp ; Supply in Capitola on Monday afternoon . You were super cute , black hair , nose ring , jeans , etc , and scowling , I was scowling too . Mine was for my current project sapping the life force out of me , which is why I fumbled until you had passed . Maybe yours was for a similar art project or at the bright sun , or at me . Maybe we can inspire each other . Maybe we can go get supplies at the same time next week ? Moving his hand from her face , he caresses her long hair . Taking the lightest dark locks in between his fingers , he twirls these parts of her fast until they pull taut and fall back to her shoulders . He enjoys this game , pulling her to him in these small bits until , slightly tortured , she falls back to her own side . He touches her soft cheek , hoping that touch will suffice for words until he has time to think things through . She smiles , happily accepting the affectionate gesture from her new lover . The brightness in her eyes takes him almost by surprise . She never seems to smile anymore . `` Dammit , he tells himself , `` Kiss her , hug her or something . . . . Either response would be too simple to explain the complexity of emotions he feels for her . She yields to his desire , turning her head to the other side and exposing her untouched skin . Deliberately , he runs the flat of his wet tongue over the salt of her neck . He does n't bite yet , but moves over her until she lies flat on top of the lumped up bed covers . From this pinned position , she comes alive . Moving only her hands , she manages to pull his t-shirt out of his belt and half way up over his back . She runs her tiny hands over the warmed , exposed skin and kisses him with a passion incomparable to that of his deviant biting . Her strong thighs wrap around his waist , pulling him to her in one swift surge . Whatever her doubts and insecurities were , she finds no solace in her concerns . Rather , she rolls over with him until she is in a half sitting position on top of his clothed body . Ravenously , she kisses him with vengeance until the saliva from within her cheeks drips easily from his slick lips . To the super cute woman I bumped into twice at two places in 10 mins , I was thoroughly charmed and I am now painfully bewitched ... Wanted to ask you to lunch but was too late in the parking lot ... . Write to me , you cutie : ) This seldom happens to me , but man it did today ! You rang me up this afternoon at ACE Hardware in Sebastopol . I saw a quick glimpse of your eyes during a typical friendly exchange at first , and could n't believe what I saw. No ... ..could n't be ... ... . But it so was true ! The biggest hazel deep green , sparkly , fantastically incredible gorgeous eyes I 've even seen ! We looked at each other as I gave you some cash , I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the money thing . Then you gave me change , I think I may have said have a great afternoon , but I locked onto , and into those perfectly clear pools of hypnotic green for what seemed like minutes ! And heres the part that seldom happens to me , they stayed with me all day and into the evening ! Like I had just left you moments ago ! I could so look at those eyes again ! Thank you ! Crossed paths at the Mexican market there Miller Ave. on Monday I think . I was next in line behind you . Would like to sit and have coffee with you , my treat .

I thought you were really attractive , but I did n't get your number . If you see this , let me know the details of our bet ! Long shot , but we played for a few minutes at the Jacks party last night . We were both in the lobby afterwards . As you were leaving , I think you said `` Thanks for letting me join .

She holds his hand by the tips of his fingers and enjoys feeling the familiar bend in his hand as he lights candles with his other hand . Fumbling , he places the candle atop the desk and moves her to his bed. She sits , patiently attentive to her thoughts , on top of the jumbled bed clothes and watches him take off his shoes with delicate balance . Holding her face , he kisses her on both cheeks before removing her glasses and placing them on the nightstand . The kisses feel good to her and she enjoys the warm breath on her goospimpled skin . Again , he kisses her softly on the face as he moves his stubbled framed mouth to her smooth lips . She pulls back slightly , startled at the roughness of his three day beard , but resumes relaxation as his kisses move from her mouth to her neck . I asked you for a light you told me the night before you drank way too much I told you how to cure that. Your BF is a bartender. I saw you glancing after we talked outside. I was looking too. I 'll have to have more dreams about `` what if ... How do i ask u to ? How do I suppress my selfish need to explore other sexual experiences while wanting u all to myself . I want to make out and cuddle with her then come home and fall deeper in love with u. I need a reboot once in a while from a real throbbing penis , but have no desire to commit to a man . We have been through so much and when my dying day comes I wanthyou holding my hand , raising our children . I 'm asking u to be stronger than me , I 'm askingbyou to let me wander while you stay faithful to me ! She gently tosses her head to one side and the dim light catches under her eyes in what almost seems to be a leery , ominous glow of intensity . He ca n't tell if she is still smiling because her face is tilted slightly to one side , but he can hear her unsure , off rhythm breath clearly . `` Come on he says , gently pulling her up from her knees . He knows he 's taking a chance with her since he 's not quite sure where they stand , but the moment is too much for him to ignore . She stands slowly , not quite sure what she thinks of the situation -- of him -- but follows him into the bedroom . and wonder is he looking at at it too ? Will he return your text if you contacted him ? What would he say if you showed up at his door ? You miss at how his hugs and caresses melted your problems away even if it was for a few days. You miss at how his flirting , laughter made you smile , laugh and brought you joy. You miss at how he magically would make the darkness disappear for a while. You miss at how his passionate kisses would make your toes curl. Then you realize , the reason he is not there still exists. He wanted more than you were willing to give. He was unwilling to accept less than he wanted. He was tired of being pushed away every time you felt the need to run away. He was tired of being the one you called only when you felt abandoned by others. You do not miss that he easily brought you sadness when he pushed back as you push him away. Sometimes events , people remind him of you like someone did last night . Sometimes events , people remind you of him . Sometimes you just want to snuggle up to him one last time , see if the fire and passion are in his kisses ... Looking for another sister CD to live with in santa rosa as a roommate.

SEND e-mail with pic so we can start this. Room is ready 6-1-15. You were by yourself , leaving as I was going in . You definitely looked at me and smiled , I thought you were very pretty and would like to say `` Hi and get to know you . I am older . I did n't mean to be rude by walking by without saying anything . You looked nervous , really pretty but nervous . I wanted to say something but I get it . Well I do n't understand any of it but I 'm not trying to come at you if you do n't want me to . I still hope you would hit me up . Hey today I walked in and ordered a drink . You were the cute cashier . With curly brownish hair and a cute smile . I thought you were hot . starbucks on capitol expressway and McLaughlin . were both the same age it was around 11.20 . You were a cute , fun loving woman dancing samba by the water ; ) . You can shake ! Was torn between watching your sensual moves or your radiant smile when you danced . You were there with friends . We smiled , we talked after the event . I wanted to dance with you later that night but you had someone. We share a mutual acquaintance , used to live in the same city , enjoyed a witty quick conversation that ended too soon. Long shot , but hey better than not trying . Christine , I 've thought about you a lot over the years and I think we really could have made a great couple . Do you believe in second chances ? We could be great together . -T Last saw you a couple of weeks ago . We were supposed to hang out again . Where did you disappear to ? You seemed like a great gal who loves the outdoors , we talked for a minute and then continued on . I think we met on Rough Go . Woe to me for not saying more ! But now I am asking , would you like to meet again , for a hike , or a drink , or both ? : ) You introduced yourself as Crystal and partnered with me at the ballroom dance lessons , and you showed me how to Waltz . I was n't planning to go to the Ball but I went in hopes of seeing you again . We danced even though I did n't know how to dance , and I told you that I was really only there so I would have a chance to dance with you again . I realized afterwards that was a mistake because of how awkward it made things . I 'm sorry I made you so uncomfortable . I hope you still had a great rest of the night , and that you find someone who treats you right because I think you are very special . Hi Corey. You were at the Cafe with friends . I was looking at the apartment ads when you were out having a cigarette . this was about 830pm . Should have given you my phone number then . Lets meet up ! Just tell me where you live , so I know it is you . I exist now dreaming in reality , shades of deep reds and grays , Evolving at the speed of light As my third eye sees all , I bring my fingers to my lips and time stops I taste you. I ponder you and wallow in the memory of your scent and way. How you called me baby The way you made me laugh The way you touched my heart and made me believe Unable to stop , it seems too wonderful , but in the end there is not much but pain. I allow this for some time , then I awake and know that I am alive and the possibilities are endless. Wanting you to taste my soul and undeniably know that I am the one and we are one to conquer happiness together , unimaginably , the way you knew that we could and will if you say one word , Yes ! Your fear . Your ego . Your pride . They protect and also hurt you , keeping you from what is rightfully yours , Love. If I had your heart again ? Oh , the way I would touch it , nurture it and protect it My most sacred gift God wants what I want , he trusts me and knows my light is pure as he does you. Say the word once. The heavens will open up and the angels will sing in our praise Because we chose. Please do n't be afraid , I am always here for you. I 'LL MISS YOU IM LEAVING THE U.S .

I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE TO MEET A PERSON AND START A FRIENDSHIP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GOES FROM THERE . Saw you on the bench reading and picking your nose . I walked by several times to get your attention but you seemed preoccupied with the nose thing . I had on grey shorts and tennies . Tell me where the bench was to make sure it 's you . I left work because you freed me from it . I had it all along - you ! My knowledge -- & gt ; wisdom -- & gt ; success w/o you ? = uncertainty You : I love you. Me : I love you more.

You are so beautiful Hispanic woman with black or brown curly hair and a lovely smile I was breathtaking . I did n't have time to say something and I did n't want to get you in to trouble . But I enjoyed locking eyes and smile with you . If you see this I would like to get together and go for coffee or Ice cream together or something . I miss the way you closed your eyes when I kissed you. I wish I could kiss you again . Wow , I did n't think anything about meeting someone at the drive thru , then I got to the window , we shared a little bit , and then I left . I have n't stopped thinking about you , I think we had a connection . I you feel the same message me back , put the name of the restaurant in the subject line , hope to hear from you soon . As I was leaving the farmers market , you were getting out of your car and then getting stuff out of the passenger 's side . You were wearing these navy yoga pants , and you were arcing your back and bending your hips in just such a way ... well , I could n't not stare . And I know you caught me staring ( off the reflection on your car ) . So - first , sorry for staring . Second , if it 's not weird to say , thank you . Your butt was the highlight of my day . Absolutely incredible ; ) If you write , tell me what color and make your car is. I posted here in a time of weakness and pain . You used it as an opportunity to judge me and browbeat me with your evangelical Christian brainwashing . You judged me as being in pain because I needed Jesus . You are dangerously misinformed about your own outer religion . when I responded to thank you but point out Mathhew 6:5 - do n't be like the hypocrites - and the Book of Job - bad things happen to great people and you should n't judge - you flew into a rage . This has happened three other times that I 've posted here . I did not ask for help or to be evangelized . I was merely telling my story . You use Jesus to aggrandize your own ego . I 'm literally thinking every day of killing myself and you are out there trying to make me feel even worse about myself through your idea of religion . You get a good feeling out of telling other people you are holier than they are when they are down . You are just awful . I should be free FROM your religion . Hey We chatted at the bar , your name was Hannah and you said you teach in San Mateo . I wish I had asked you out , but you left ... .. You were going to see Dior and I , I was in the lobby waiting for friends . We smiled and said hello . Would love to meet you . We could not keep our eyes from eachother ... You in your black leather jacket and kids , me in black shirt and jeans . I tried to figure out a way to come introduce myself but you seemed to be with your family ! You 'll never see this I 'm sure but just for fun You were in the yellow muscle shirt . I was staring and admiring your beautiful , large hard pecs . You smiled big at me , and I got embarrassed . I 'm working on that -- should have said hi . Hi ? We met on the beach with our dogs . I told you I loved red hair . When you told me you were a high school teacher I told you the boys must be hot for you . You said you were stressed from finals . I can help . We can go to nude beach and be totally free and relaxed then my place where I have massage table for a sensual full body massage then I would give you totally oral bliss . And that just the beginning BABY , I AM SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW I TREATED YOU.LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS NO GOOD , YOUR MY SUNSHINE , MY BABY GIRL .I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AND START NEW ! I COULD TYPE FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT I WISH OR WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD RATHER BE LOOKING INTO YOUR SEXY BROWN EYES AND TELLING YOU INPERSON ... .THIS SUCKS BABY : I NEED YOU , WANT YOU , MISS YOU !

Ps ... ... i love you baby ! Leoncio Navarro i really want to see you . If your attached or not . Please find me . T I have moments in my day when I think about us . I do n't cry anymore , sigh at times and maybe clear my throat , but it 's not at all like the first time . I have realized that the greatest gift you gave me was the lesson in loving myself and realizing my worth . It may have come at a cost , because in that very process I learned that our failures were not worth carrying around but rather to be placed under my feet and used as stepping stones to something better. I ca n't begin to tell you how many times I have ended something with someone simply because your voice echoes in my head `` you are better than that , you deserve more I always credit you for my change of behavior and even though it makes me want to scream at times , I am most pleased with the outcome : - ) your love paved the way to a healthier me and I needed you to know that it was not all for nothing ! In some attempts , it is glorious even to fail I saw you in Carls Jr in Martinez SATURDAY about 6 or 7pm . You were with another girl & amp ; some young dude . You had pushed a baby stroller to your table . When I first saw you , I was so hooked . I could n't take my eyes off you . I left a note for you to find , I pray . Then when I drove away , past the window where you were sitting , ... you and the other chick were totally staring at me , & amp ; both of you were waving at me . YOU MADE MY YEAR , ..THANK YOU SO MUCH ! ! I 'M THE `` BEAVER PLEASER & amp ; I 'd love 2 lick your sweet Beaver again and again and again and again just to see your BEAUTIFUL SMILE .

CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME , CONTACT ME ! So , you were at 90 's night tonight and you were by far the coolest human there . Your moves were solid across the board , and you were clearly there for the music , not to hook up , which is why I Ieft you way the hell alone ( also : social anxiety ) . BUT ( and this is a big but ) , it maybe seemed like you could be could be interested , or maybe I am totally off base . You were present , but , like , never actively pursuing , so it 's hard to tell . Anyway , um , you had light jeans on and a tight black top that really highlighted your quite exquisite back . I was just , you know , a white human , black shirt , basically the most boring thing ever . But I promise I am at least a little cool , if you did want to reach out . K. Good night . Too weak and tired to write much tonight ; why is my muse not bringing me coffee and rolling me with a rolling pin ? It 's in the job description . Anyhow , this is the best I can do tonight , despite all the beautiful women in the world ... : -/ The nIght of the hot red things I 've seen big cafeterias And vaulted marble ceilings , I 've seen dark things mysterious And people with no feelings I 've seen bright fields of roses And golden onion domes , I 've seen misshapen noses , And brand new mobile homes I 've seen two tits to die for , And Martin Luther King , I 've seen San Bernardino , And damn near everything ! But something that I 'm missing Which it seems I need to see , Is a year or two of kissing you , In the third degree ! Three More Bloody Haikuses Not infrequently I feel like I will die Love is a life boat Thinking of your face At times when you look happy Helps me to survive Following one 's heart Leads one through flaming canyons And down to the beach If I need you more than I want you ...

Beautiful blonde , 60ish , at contra dance tonight , Saturday , May 23 , Wischelman Hall , Sebastopol . We danced one dance and you left before I had a chance to talk to you . Would love to connect . I 'm looking for a cute , sweet and drop-dead gorgeous girl whose name is Dulce who was a manager at a Carl 's Jrs at 1999 Camden Ave ( San Jose , CA ) with Marylou . Dulce speaks Spanish as well. I do n't want to flirt nor date . I just want to say hi and know how is she doing. Hi , Dulce . You worked at Carls Jrs ( Union and Camden ) I ate there almost every weekend since November 2012 till December 2013. Dulce , you probably remember me . You sighed virtually every time you saw me . How are you ? You were upstairs having a drink with your friends sitting on a stool overlooking the drunk dancers . You wore glasses and a white top and I could just tell you had a good vibe to you . Would love to get to know you better . You came in looking for a restroom..Then came back with a smile to update me..I wish we had just a minute longer I 'm wondering if you saw me ? I thought maybe you were looking into my eyes , because I Was looking into yours . I was inside and you were walking by with a friend . I looked thru the window and between the fence , you were wearing black fitness pants with a yellowish top and a Scarlett scarf/headband . If you saw me ? Let me know . Never thought I 'd see my girl til I saw you tonight . You were at the corner of 23rd and Castro making a left , listening to Pac and smoking a cigarette . You stopped me in my tracks and I could n't look away . I was walking up 23rd backwards looking at you take a drag off that smoke while you made the left . Silver Hyundai . How many girls listen to Pac rolling around by themselves ? If you saw me let me know and tell me what I was wearing . If you see this and you do n't wan na reach out I just got ta say keep doin you , it looks like it 's working . You know no one does it it like you . When I was sad , I let myself be sad . Well I guess it 's time to be happy . You fill my dreams and nightmares . Let me taste you , my longing for you as I grip my knees on either side of you . Let me make it up to you . I wish the best for you . I was really good to you . I just love your secret smile . I do n't think I 'll post here again . I 'm in a place of peace and hope . I am even more puzzled , than hurt . It 's a real shame too . It 's just something I 'd do for you . Hear me moan as you take a fist of my hair in one hand my flesh in the other . Have a nice life . Have a great weekend ! Be kind to me . As I said , there is someone waiting for me out there . All the love I felt but could n't express . All pain and nothing about it . Accept it and cherish it . Sat for an hour and a half trying to work up to go in and ask you out . I do n't think you 've realized it but every single time ive walked into your jobs , this and the one before and unless im mistaken theres one that was before that but I just liked to go and kinda check you out , its been with the intent to ask you out on a date . I really suck at it . I see you almost daily at World Gym and we exchange smiles every now and then . I wish I can say more or be any more descriptive , but if I did I 'll reveal who you are . If you think it is you that I am talking about , send me an email with what you were wearing at the gym today . Hi Cutie , You were sitting next to me at a stop light and you reached back to roll the window down so your son could say hi to me. HMU -- let 's chat . We had some hot fun a month or two again and I 'd love to feed you my cock again . I loved your submissive and how you too my thick cock Respond back with what we did and how you look so I know its you Hope to hear from you ; I donthave grindr anymore so lost contact I hope , I hope you see this . I was sitting at the window counter sipping an iced tea and reading . You were in line and then you sat next to me while you waited for your drink . I could n't think of anything to say but what I wanted to say was . `` hi , I love you hair Cute boots. You look to be about 50-55 grey hair , stocky build ... .you were wearing nice blue plaid type shirt and had your face buried in the paper . We exchanged glances a few times I thought you were very nice looking , any way if you are into guys and remember my greeting , say hello and see where this nice bottom guy can take you ... . If the stars align perhaps we can meet again ... ... . Damn this short attention span I was perfectly content on my island , but you came in like a monsoon , sucking me out to sea . Floating in the warmth of your intentions . The calm winds began to change , sputtering gusts at first . Tropical blasts battered followed by arctic chills sending me so off course there was no hope of finding my way back . Now I 'm left adrift , watching the compass spin , knowing that the next rush will be the final blow that drowns me . Please just put me back where you found me . Good looking tall black guy wearing scrubs and a jacket . Made eye contact several times . Discreet professional white guy here standing across from you . Would love to connect if you see this . Let me know what was on your jacket so I know it 's you . I know I probably enjoyed that just as much , if not more than you . i wanted to add a few sweet little kisses in here and there on your neck and shoulder area but it would have been a little bit improper.i hope you take me up on my offer , a little bit of privacy and better setting will make a world 's difference . i promise to remain a complete gentleman the entire time and respect any limitations you may have.just keep in mind im willing to go the extra mile ... ... .

Each day I get on BART , I see you when you get on at Orinda before we head into the tunnel towards SF , you stand right by the door , heading I know not where , I 'd like to be able to say something to you , even a hi , but I 'm too shy to . I 'm the one with the bike and the bike clothes , sitting there in the seat wishing I could just say something , but then Embarcadero comes and I have to get off because I 'm going to work , flying around the city , delivering goods . I would love to actually get to talk to you , but this biker is very shy . I do n't know if you 'll be there the next time I ride and each time I can only hope . Please be that Hope . you just got to your parked car and I was walking by.. you put your backpack in the trunk , put money in the meter and then passed me.. when you walked towards me you said `` helllo.. or how are you I said hello back . I watched you walk down the street . man.. you are so handsome . In the unlikely event that you see this.. email me so we can meet for coffee sometime . Hello there , you like being outdoors and hiking on trails and need a new friend to talk to , I am a working guy who would like to meet another easygoing person to get to know better and have some hiking fun on the weekends . I am looking for relationship and love ... . You Latin looking bear with that hot beard hanging around at closing . Me stocky masculine bearded white linebacker who wanted to seriously put your legs over my shoulders and make you beg . This is a long shot but if you are out there reading this and interested HMU. Tell me what it is about your beard that is different so I know it 's you . 24 Hour Fitness , SuperSport on Crane To the cute girl with glasses jogging around between sets , I 'm glad you took an extra lap by me as I was finishing up .

If this is you , and you 're interested , please reply and tell me what my vehicle was so I know it was you . I just wanted to say thank you for your compassion . My girlfriend and I were there with our dog who we ended up having to let go . From the exam room I heard the tech apologizing for the wait and could hear you saying it was no problem , that you understood ... I would like to think that most people in your shoes would feel the same way , but working in a veterinary hospital myself , I know that people can be amazingly insensitive and selfish when made to wait under similar circumstances . So thank you so much for your kindness , patience , and compassion . I hope your dog is okay , he was really cute and under any other circumstances I would have given him all the attention he seemed to want from us ! Take care , and please know that your small kindness made a big difference to us on that very painful night . As I came out of Trader Joes you were there with your children and you looked at me like you knew me and you said Hi and you took my breath you were so beautiful . I am pretty sure I said Hi back but I walked straight to my car . OMG you were so beautiful and I ca n't shake that feeling that you must know me . as God is my witness , love will prevail . I have you in my sights , and , to quote our nasal friend Mr. Declan P. MacManus , `` My aim is true ! `` C. x S. I had suitcases , you had ( blank ) . Very sexy eyes , gave me great thoughts through the day ... . You- Beauty in a light blue suv. Me- Red shirt , white truck. I should n't have gotten off at my exit ... You had no makeup on , white shirt with black yoga pants . You have a beautiful face . I was by you on bart with a grey sweatshirt . Lets talk ... .email me and tell me its you by saying what oakland stop you got off at ... . I know this is a long shot but you were wearing a north face coat earlier this week . I saw you by bart , you had glasses on . This is to just say hi and maybe become friends , nothing else , you look like you have a lot on your mind and could use a person to talk to . I dont have any ill intentions just friends . I am a man and would respect any situation your in . I saw this couple near Mission/15th and the male was being very aggressive and looked like he was about to be abusive . I 'd really like to know whether this was a school experiment to see what passersby would say . It freaked me out and I 'd like to ease my mind . ( I did yell at him that I 'd taken his picture so he better not hurt her but I had kids in the car so I felt I could n't do more . ) You look fancy in that somewhat short green skirt . You got good legs and an attractive look and physique . I got into pumping gas seeing you were pumping gas in the pump near De Anza Park : ) Seems you noticed I looked at you - may be not , could not be sure. You are pretty. I 've seen you while riding my bike down Shattuck while you wait for the 18 . I have seen you a few times on the 18 towards Albany/Solano , also . You usually get on somewhere around Alcatraz , I think , sometimes on Ashby. We 've smiled at each other pleasantly , though I 've always wanted to strike up a conversation with you , despite you wearing headphones ( and I recognize that 's maybe the point of wearing them and I do not fault you for wanting to be left alone on public transit ) . I 'm a tall , bearded , glasses-wearing goober who is often reading or slipping back and forth between awake and asleep thanks to the early hour and the warm bus ride . I think we 'd get along , though I ca n't really say why. Would you be interested in getting a pint or a tumbler or a cuppa something sometime ? I would relish the opportunity to get to know you better . Hi , Beautiful girl who was sitting next to me on IHSS Orientation at 1 pm today . You left your SS card in the car . Please get back to me if you read this. Greg Easily the prettiest/hottest/sexiest woman I think I have ever seen ! Seriously . Super model style . Anyone else notice how perfect that woman was ? Grey denim . Bun . Painted toes . Trying my best to be respectful. Anyways , made my day as I stood in that shitty line . So big thanks , to the brunette who , I 'm assuming is a model . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . * I do n't take much shit from ladies , *even the sexy/hot girls . EVER . I would let this woman walk all over me like a loser . Actually I would n't . But some dude is a lucky S.O.B. This is whats up to that cute ass asian working out at the Fremont 24 by Bart around the noon time . Just saying whats up tho . I have n't seen you in so long . I 've made too many mistakes to make it right . I hope you 're doing well . I love you ... forever I 'm lost for words . Yes , me . I know it took a lot for you to do that . Thank you but just know that I 'm trying to make `` sense of it . Even though I do n't think `` sense has anything to do with this ( smile ) . I will admit , you scare me a little bit , but in a good way . Please be patient with me , I do n't know what to do and that is the truth. I was the gent that waved to you and thought that you were so wonderful ! I am hoping if you are single that you would go out with me for a coffee date ? If interested let me know ok ... ... . sincerely me ... . You get me off the equipment I was using so you could complete your routine I would love to get to know you better and i wish you end up reading this Tell me which equipment I was using I 'm looking to find and reconnect with you , we met and went on a couple dates . You were really nice and pretty . Curvy , had a nose ring , pretty short hair from what I remember and tattoos . Things ended but I wish they did n't . Please reply . You 've recently worked with my family putting in a sport court . I 'm not really the type to post something like this but you 've been on my mind ever since you came by to show us your tiles . I 've heard through the grapevine that your a divorced dad of one . Is there any chance you 'd be interested in a divorced mom of one ? I 'm secure , sane , and your sense of humor is right up my ally . I hope I hear back . I 'm mixed black and white , short hair , glasses and beard You said your name was _hil , ''like Phil , but with a _ . and that you were headed to Temescal to meet with some friends.

Thanks for letting me know I almost forgot my plant ! Coffee sometime ? ... that after three grueling years I may have finally turned the corner health-wise . A misread MRI and a therapist who knows the correct course of treatment give me hope where there was none . So this is a good chance to thank you for the support you have given me in your own special way . It 's been nothing short of astonishing ... I literally do n't know how I would have survived without you . I truly do n't know where your heart lies , I think you can feel my confusion when I go off on one of my jackass rifts ... if it 's with someone else , that makes your support of me even more amazing . You are an angel , one sent here to help me through my darkest hour and if I can ever do anything for you all you need do is pick up the phone . Whoever you love is the luckiest person on the face of this earth and should never take that for granted . xxoo Met you at the bar , I only stayed for a quick beer.. You are from PA and here on business . I wanted to buy you a drink but I was in a hurry . Maybe we can meet up for a drink when you 're back in the area ?

You were at the cash machine on Thursday morning around 8:30 AM . You had your hair colored red . Something about your simplicity and your naturalness really got me staring at you , was shy to approach you as I thought you might not be interested in a 40 year old guy . If you see this , hope you respond back . Love your personality and overall rad vibe. I 'd love to get to know you better. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. I 've seen you a couple times and I 'm amazed by you tall gorgeous smile . I think you noticed me checking you out.Never posted on here but I 'm shy and a bit intimidated . Doubt you 'll see this but if you do please say hi . You are and older yet fit white man . You are always wearing black or gray sleeveless shirts and shorts . We always make eye contact when you are on a stationary bike in the front . You are on there all the time before you work out and post workout . I overheard someone call you and your name is john . Super sexy man . I also saw you driving off in a BMW . We locked eyes and smiled to each other on BART . You even looked back when you got off at Montgomery Street . I tried to find you but got lost in the shuffle . I walked around the block and even went to Starbucks , just for a chance to say hi. Me : Young guy in a yellow/gray hoodie. You : Beautiful brunette in a slim-fitting dress with black leggings and red lipstick. I felt something this morning . If you did too , please respond . This is uncharacteristic but ca n't get you out of my head so figured I give this a shot. It was last Saturday . I stopped into Rite Aid . You were working the register closest to the door. A beautiful brunette with glasses . You said hello , I said it back . I grabbed what I needed and stood in line . We made eye contact a few times while waiting . Maybe you thought I was suspicious , maybe something else . I ended up at the other register . We made eye contact again . On my way out I said goodbye and you responded back. I 'm not sure what your situation is but I ca n't shake you. You have beautiful eyes and a gorgeous smile . Please message me back if there is something real or it was all in my head J Mathilda says hi . Too bad you 've been banned my friend . I just hope you did n't get wasted on coconut water to compensate ... Wow you are super cute ! I could n't stop staring at you as you walked through the cross . I gave a smile you gave one back and then , , , I noticed your bum and you looked back and caught me , guess i was n't to discrete . I hope I did n't creep you out , sorry , but you are adorable . I hope you see this and know I 'm gon na be day dreaming about you and your amazing body , probably for the rest of the week. Thanks for walking in front of my truck ! Sorry for the misunderstanding . I have good intentions ... just asking for peace nothing more . Hope I did n't offend you . Have a nice day . : - ) This post was a fine post , in addition I think it should be added that often enough a relationship can become so strained that one or both parties decide that the relationship is beyond an ability to reconcile . We 're all grown ups though , we all know that . While I believe in mutual understanding , understandably it 's a well that can go dry . Like anything if you do n't take care of the things you have , you ca n't expect to keep it . Honesty is probably a key factor . Responsibility for ones actions another in reconciliation. I like this topic I see you all the time , and love your smiles and your sexy outfits.Always look forward to seeing you cross paths with me.If your interest is piqued , respond to this and I will share some more details .

Hi Sam , Hopefully this gets to her or someone she knows . I am a classmate of yours and I wanted to let you know I do have a print for you. I had to leave in rush because a friend who is in town and staying with me was at my front door and had to run back home. I realized I didnt give you my info so that once I made another print I could give it to you . Sorry I found a print that I did make and its yours for free Just contact me and its yours. take care : ) Hello , You were dancing to your music in your van this morning on the 101 freeway headed north . We flirted back and forth , and I loved your shy smile . I blew you a kiss and you caught it : ) I wish I could have said hello , but being on the freeway made that pretty impossible . I know this is a long shot , but was the best option i can think of to try to find you . If by chance you see this , I 'd love to hear from you . If you do write , please tell me what I was driving so I know it you . Here 's hoping ! D My presence exists only with you. Can you feel it now ? Could you feel me coming ? Did you retreat somewhere safer ? I would n't blame you . It 's terrifying here . I do n't know what 's more terrifying ... Be it the unfathomable extent to which life has changed ? Or the painfully beautiful memories I never even considered I could miss proving me wrong . A lifetime of memories ; compressed into a few distinct feelings : all equallyIntense , abrasive , soul piercing as one another . Ca n't shift my focus ... You overflow my mind , It 's splitting at the seams ; terrified of what it dreams The rain continues to fall Nostalgia prevails over all Will you notice me or look away ? Are you even there ?

Please contact me , Joe You were the tall brunette with near perfect body that farted in the bread last night . I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked `` Was that you ? You quickly replied `` No it was n't me ! As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence , but it was evident . I tried to get rid of the stench by waving two loaves of Ciabetta bread . You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner . You 're beautiful and even if you were a liar and fart like a Clydesdale I 'd love to meet up . Friends recognize each others limits and value each other enough to not continuing to cross those metaphorical lines . Friends value each other 's truth and respect each other enough to at least not lie . Nothing is one sided , odds are in favor of both sides having a role in the play . But there is a scale of acceptable behavior . There does exist something that 's referred to as fair play . I tried to have patience and I was very forgiving . Even willing to take you back for a twice broken trust . You put me through hell . Should n't have wasted our time killing each other. I 'm all out of fight.

Im looking for serious replies only ... ..Hurry up and get it ! ! ! LIMITED TIME ONLY ! ! ! ! ! The last ten years passed so quick that I have found myself in a place that I do not like . The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands .

You forgot your detergent and had to go back home around 6:45 . I was standing on the corner , waiting for my friend to arrive for dinner , when you walked by . He and I parted ways in the median around 8 and you passed by us -- back to the laundromat , earbuds in your ears , glasses on your nose , flip-flops on your feet -- walking in rhythm the whole time . You got on the F train this morning at about 8:30 AM with an older white gentleman . You had a star of David necklace on , a striped black and white shirt with some fitted jeans . You had a light colored coat on as well . You looked so cute and I wanted to talk to you but it seemed like you were riding with who could have been your dad . I had jeans on with a bright orange polo . I had my headphones on and tried to make eye contact with you. I would love to take you out sometime . Contact me !

( as more mondays blow by , i work saving up for the day where i realize we either never see each other again and i take the train home or i always , always take it to you . ) see you all next week . Beautiful Asian woman driving an Audi over the GWB in the car pool around 5:30pm Monday 6/15 . You gave rides to two passengers and we both sat in the back .

I saw you walking yesterday with your boyfriend I believe . Before you crossed the street we could n't take our eyes off one another . I am pretty sure you were a tourist . I was in a navy suit on Kenmare/Lafayette w a beard . You were way too hot for him . about 3:30 , u were about to leave and i was getting there we looked at each other , eye to eye contact , u gave me a look saw u walking out with a friend about 5 minutes later u had a hoody on and a small bag like a backpack tell me the color of your hoody and the color of the bag so i know its u im a muscular total top by the way Your kid was with you and we locked eyes a few times as you left Sake . I could n't keep up my end due to shyness and because my attention was split with my own kid at our table . I do n't think I saw a ring , so if not , maybe I can make it up to you ? If you need more details , I was wearing a white patterned shirt and came into the restaurant shortly after you did , and I think I heard you ask the desk worker for two forks . You 're a tall brunette and that 's all I 'll say ! Looking for Jordy , we met on the downtown C train , you asked me what happened to my eye ( I had a band-aid over a cut ) . We chatted & amp ; you made me laugh & amp ; blush . I had to rush getting off at my stop on 14th/8th ave . I 'd like our paths to cross again . I see you a lot . you are a sexy light eyed handsome guy that I talk to at work . I tell you that I like you and maybe you have no clue as to how much I like you . Hit me back if you recognise yourself here by telling me the town you work in and what you do so I know its you . Ill reply with the name of the store so you know its you Im talking about . Love to get coffee with you and start off as friends first but more later you have handsome good looks light eyes and a beautiful body Hey Ben , We met in line waiting for the Bolt Bus in DC and were the two stand bys to make it in the 1:30pm . Guess we both had a shy moment and did n't ask for each other 's contact when we said goodbye in Manhattan . But I 'd love to go for a drive sometime ! Gim me a shout . ; ) naOMi Why were you ok with watching me walk away ? Do you know how many times I just wanted to reach out and hold your hand ?

Im looking for serious replies only ... ..Hurry up and get it ! ! ! LIMITED TIME ONLY ! ! ! ! ! The last ten years passed so quick that I have found myself in a place that I do not like . The other day my son asked me `` dad who was your first girlfriend ? I could not process the feelings that fell upon me . It feels like yesterday that your friend approached me and said that you thought I was cute . We talked all night . I leaned toward you with my hands in my pocket so you did not see them shake and we kissed , which was the first of thousands . We would talk for hours about nothing . During our first argument , we laughed and marked the occasion romantically . Our love was pure . Material items meant nothing . Our relationship continued on and off for many years . You decided to stay local and I had dreams of conquering the world . We always returned to each other but I always left with more to conquer . I recall that night that I wanted to take you out before I left again . You just wanted to spend time alone and talk , like we always did . We went to the beach and danced under the stars . You felt that we were soul mates . We were two parts to the same soul that could not live without the other . We promised to remain together forever . You never had to say I love you because I saw it in your eyes . You always wrote me long notes for my voyage afraid that I would forget you . In your last note you asked that I not change for anyone . I was gone too long when you called to tell me that someone had proposed . I know that you wanted me to stop you . We would occasionally talk and I knew that the DB was taking you down a bad path . As my life was now in motion I was a few months away from my return to reclaim my kingdom . I had built a considerable army but I was planning to leave the armor and troops behind . I was absolutely certain that when I returned all I had to do was close my eyes and reach out my hand . Before I could return I received a call that you were in the hospital . I rushed home but did not make it . I walked into the wake and felt numb . I had lost the only pure thing in my life . I had returned , married and started a family . Lately , when I look at her I am reminded that I broke your promise . I am sorry but I did change . Last night I had a dream that I passed away . As I open my eyes my soul is walking toward your parent 's stoop . There you are sitting waiting for me . Hey ladies , I am a 38 year old guy from the US Virgin Islands . I visit Brooklyn regularly ( 4-5 times a year ) , and planning to make Brooklyn my home permanently by year end . I will visit a few times between now and then as well .

Though we had a secret connection but seemed we are both shy . Wish I said hi - tried to give you a signal . If interested hit me up ... maybe a coffee meat . I do n't know if it was concert etiquette and you 're always such a gentleman , or if I missed the signals . Ciro- email me ! M We both got on at 207th street today. The bus was really packed and yet people still tried to get on . We both laughed it at but clearly wanted to get going. You were the hot Asian guy in a white tee-shirt with green sleeves and I was the black guy to your left in the gray shirt that got off at Pelham parkway . I really wish I had said hello but your attractiveness was so intimidating . I do n't know if you felt any interest or if you like guys at all . Just thought I should let you know that I wish I had at least said hello . If you are interested ... maybe we could have coffee ? : ) I do n't want another woman , but I feel the same way . If you 're traveling tomorrow , then we should talk tonight . Smart , funny , kind , successful , honest , all American single guy I know your out there , we just need our paths to cross i was the excruciatingly shy idiot you were doing circles around and staring at on the 4 train , 6/11 at about 12:30 . i know i am , and was , a total idiot . it 's not like i ca n't talk to people , i 've chatted up girls before and like to talk to random people , but there was something about you that just made me as shy and anxious as i ever was ... and though you were doing circles around me i just did n't have the nerve to talk to you. i do n't know why i was that stupid , but i was ... i wish you 'd see this ... . light blue shirt , dark blue jeans , purple moccasins. what were you wearing ? what part of the platform were we on ? what station was your destination ? Yes . Actually he is a cop . How do you know ? Do you know someone that fits this description . We should chat . You were with your friends but not a guy , because you told me you were single . I was with my boy , we sat down and ate next to your table . When we got up to leave , my friend went to the restroom , and you and I had a brief but very nice conversation . I loved your smile and the way you laughed . You told me to meet you at another place the old `` Umbrellas , but I ended going somewhere else . Would love to see you again . Reply with your name ( starts with an A ) and what you were wearing so I know its you . Every part of my body was sticking to every other part of my body . The summer and subway were oppressive . And then you walked through the closing doors in your little white shoes . Hey Dude ! My phone messed up when I tried texting you the photo , and now I lost your number . We took pics together twice because the first shots were blurry . ( and you gave me a little squeeze on the shoulder while posing . : ) ) Reach out to me and let me know its you ! Would love to stay in touch ! I dont mean to be awkward by doing this but you are absolutely gorgeous ... I hope i didnt make you uncomfortable when i told you that you are beautiful..you really are..and if i wasnt so nervous I would have said more . Plus , I was in work clothes and looked horrible . Doubt you 'd ever see this but if by some miracle you do , email me . I would be really happy to hear from you and get the chance to get to know you . We exchanged like 7 glances as we crossed paths . I thought about following you into the store , but that felt creepy . So I 'm posting a missed connection , because that 's way less creepy. Give me a shout. i liked you from the first time i saw you . you told me you 're married but i just want to hear your story . You were standing near the fountain and caught my eye . I was walking with friends but we glanced at each other several times as I walked off . PLEASE NO TexTing 's & amp ; Blocked Call 's Will Be IGNORED VersTop Girl 4 Any Generous guy ONLY ! ! LET me FIll ur Mouth 9'inc cock & amp ; Creamy & amp ; Do 69 . On Saturday afternoon , you -- a fit friendly brother in blue shirt and shorts , with the serious stretching routine -- and I -- tall , extra-light , and slim with a bright blue shirt -- shared the captain 's chair buy the busy dip stand doing leg raises , and a few smiles . I commented that you were an acrobat after your first set , and you smiled broadly and laughed . I wanted to chat , but you became understandably preoccupied having discovered you lost your Metrocard . I was leaving and in the locker room , but did not get a chance to connect . Let 's go for a walk and a talk , with more laughter . ; - ) You were standing maybe 20 feet from me as we were both 'straphanging'. I immediately noticed you in your sleeveless sundress ( my weakness ) and with your arm raised to grip the bar , you revealed your gorgeous armpit hair. You caught me gaping in delight , and before I could look away , I saw your mischievous smile and that gleam in your eye that acknowledged a wanton disregard for the approval of the sanctimonious Stepford wives. Not to mention your amusement of knowing you made my day . I love your natural beauty , and you 're a drop dead gorgeous woman . How about a deal ? If you manage to see this , I 'll take you out for coffee.

Amazing Blue Eyes - Wanted to chat more but I thought you were spoken for with double baby carriage . I really do hope I see you again . This is a total shot in the dark . We were walking down 9th near each other for about a block , you smiled at me , and then you went into the Google building . I 'm embarrassed to admit I followed you in - I was hoping to catch up with you and say hi , but you were already at the security desk . I chickened out ( and felt like a total creeper ) when you spotted me . I ducked into Starbucks . Now I 'm regretting it . You : Jeans , boots , tee shirt , messenger bag with a picture of a bridge ( ? ) on it . I could n't take my eyes off you and I wish I had said hi . Coffee ? Drinks ? Let me know what I was wearing or send a pic so I know it 's you ! young models floor person I think your latino about 22 you helped me w sneakers I wanted a 2nd pair me : older nice looking white guy I would love to take you out and start something w you I think your so hot You are a police officer , you and a group were waiting for coffee . I think I fell in love when I saw your . I 'm the girl was was in the green shirt and Knicks hat . Find me- this is a ridiculous stab in the dark but what the hell , you 're handsome . i walked into the locker room around 3:45pm and you were the blonde guy making his way from the showers/steam . we made eye contact and i thought you were quite good looking . our lockers ended up being across the room from each other and i checked you out a few times as you were getting changed to leave . I just arrived and was getting ready to work out . I 'd love to actually say hi sometime but if you see this ... reach out ? Today around noon- You were coming from the shower/steam room I was headed down the stairs . We changed next to each other and kept looking . We are both vgL 25-30 tell me what color my hat was Feel weird even doing this but I see you all the time when I am having a few beers after work . You seem like a cool chick and you seem very fun . We chat a bit here and there but I am always a little nervous to keep the conversation going . I 'm shy and you 're older than me so I 'm a bit intimidated lol Not to mention I am in a complicated relationship . Anyway you 're super cute and you gave me a free drink ! ! Best bartender ever : ) hope to see you soon . `` If you were worried about where I went or who I saw or what club I went to w my homies , baby do n't worry , you know that you got me . Legendary song by thee Legendary Roots Crew . OH , they call you , Mr. Boombastic , say you 're fantastic , touch your back and say you 're Mr . Romantic . Swoon . I do n't think it 's too soon.. For us to take that leap of faith . A funny thing happened today . An old friend of mine wrote to me like , `` I know this ball player.. And he think you 're pretty.. I said , I 'm in love with a friend and counting stars on the way to Mars waiting for a time , that we can call ours . I hope you have a good weekend . `` And when you 're sweating on stage..think of me when you rhyme..do n't be listening to your homies..they be leaving you blind . I 've been using this time , to unwind.. I hope you do n't mind . This feels like kids ' stuff , and maybe it is just going into the ether ( perhaps it should , for you wore an engagement ring and I , a wedding band ) . I was having such a lousy day . You wore purple shorts and when I glimpsed your lovely , friendly face , and your amazing legs , I smiled. You carried a guitar , and packages from Trader Joe 's . We shared an all-too-brief exchange . ( I tried not to stare at your legs . ) You got off at Times Square and , leaving , you turned back to bid me good-day . Thank you for that gesture . It made all the difference today , and though we will never again meet , I hope to keep your impression in my heart forever . I would usually never even contemplate posting on here .. But I can not get you out of my head since I saw you . We were traveling on the north east corridor , heading into Manhattan on Friday June 5th.. You got on at Princeton Juntion .. I think .. At least I notice you after . How could I not ? Handsome and tall , in jeans , a leather jacket and leather boots . You had a leather messenger bag that 's tied on the strap as well . We caught each other 's eyes multiple times and smiled at one another . I know you wanted to talk I could sense it . I was its being a typical stupid girl . I regret that now , I should of said hi . You 're about 6 ft tall , darker complexion , maybe Latin . We got off the train you were right behind me the whole way until we separated off the escalator . I 've been dying to reconnect . Hoping we some how run into each other . It felt like it was straight out of a movie . I do n't believe in fate , but when it comes to that mmoment I sure felt something . I hope you see this .. Or someone you know sees this and tells you ! ! ! Some songs speak more truths and describe life and love so much more eloquently , then I ever could. My whole world is black. I 'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter , so why do I sear ? Twisted thoughts that spin round my head , I 'm spinning , I 'm spinning , how quick the sun can drop away. All the love gone bad turned my world to black Tattooed all I see , all that I am , all I 'll ever be. I knew someday you 'd have a beautiful life , I knew you 'd be a star in somebody else 's sky , But why , why , why could n't it be , could n't it be mine ? ? ? Why : ( Mary from Brooklyn , we met a few month ago , you just had a baby , I did n't mean to stop talking to you , I lost my phone and all my contacts. ? Being looking for it now for a while hoping it was backed up somewhere bit no luck . If you see this , im sure you still have my number and if you do n't we can exchange on here . So we do n't get confused , ? you white , and I 'm African , I live in Manhattan , you live in Brooklyn . With my fingers crossed hope you see this , this is my last option . .. We both got on the G at Greenpoint avenue . You were wearing black shoes and a light blue printed sun dress and had really nice curly blonde hair . You were reading something that had to do with greece or greeks because I saw one word in your book and it said `` Aegean . I was a guy who looks like lots of other guys in Brooklyn , but I was wearing rolled up blue pants with a white printed shirt with buildings on it. The train jerked to a stop and we grazed arms , but neither of us pulled away . I can not remember riding a train that close to another person that seemingly wanted to be close to me . We walked in lock-step with one another transfering to the E at court square , and then you disappeared . We had a moment , and I know you felt it too . I just want to say that I 've not yet rolled over . I saw , right up to the hour before you told me it was over , the way you melted when I gave you that look . I know what happened now . I forced you to show your hand too early . I 'm sorry . I 'm willing to take a step back and try again . I 'm going to give you some space for now , but I 'm not quite ready to move on . You were my waiter today and commented on my watch . If interested in chatting etc , hit me up . Name the restaurant where you work . In the locker room . Hardly anyone was there . You slipped out of your clothes into a towel . You look mid/late 20s trim build/abs , and you looked over at me to see if I was watching you . Saw you shaving your head/shoulders by the sink . You came back to your locker and looked over at me again while engaged in sports talk with a heavyset guy . I 'm the gl older guy , and I think it 'd be great to get to know you better. You caught me staring at your feet and shoes . I wanted to come over and ask if I could take you for lunch so you can decide if you would enjoy having me as your submissive but I was too afraid . I hope you see this and contact me . If you are not the woman who caught me but you are reading this and you think you would enjoy having a submissive I BEG you to allow me to present myself to you . We were riding on the D train from BK into Manhattan . We were facing each other about 10 feet apart- I was standing by the center pole , you were seated . You were wearing big headphones , reading , day dreaming . We made eye contact and exchanged fun smiles until I got off at 34 Herald Square . My business card was in my hand , I should of given you my number , but chickened out . I 've been kicking myself all day for that . In case you ever see this , please respond with the color of my jacket and something else that lets me know it 's you . The most beautiful female I have seen in a very longtime . I see you once in a while but when I do your so bad lol . You had blue jeans black shirt with some brownish boots with leopard spots on them I think . U also had a brownish bag to and got off on 14 st . I hope u read these things It had just started to rain . I was sitting under an umbrella at the tables in the median at 14th St & amp ; 9th Ave . I was waiting to meet a blind date and asked if you were her . We hit it off . The connection was obvious , but I did n't get your number , because my date was due any second , and how tacky would that have been , for her to arrive as another girl 's punching her number into my phone ? I remember your name . Email me with it , so we do n't let a perfectly romantic moment go to waste . If you get this , clearly , you 're the one I was supposed to meet that night . You were having a drink with a girlfriend in the lobby bar last week . Not sure you noticed me checking you out since you were engaged in conversation . Put name of the hotel in your reply . Wednesday on the uptown C Train . You 're tall - probably 6'3 or 6'4 ' . You were sitting by me - you had made a B-line for the seat next to me when you got onto the train . Our arms brushed a lot as the train started and stopped , but it did n't seem you ever looked at me . I was n't sure you were really interested . I was reading , but stopped because there was so much noise . You got off at 50th ; it was 6:35pm . We looked at each other as you stood by the door ; you slightly smiled. Still interested ? Give a brief description of me or tell something about the situation so I know it 's you . Really interested to know who that is , but he has been an enigma . Like Kayzer Soze , if you can imagine . Walks really fast as well . Guessing he is at least 6 feet tall , somewhat skinny but athletic as well . Not a stalker by any means , however would like to at least know who he is . Doubt this helps , but I am somewhat desperate . He might be a bum anyway , but who knows . He also visits the healthy food store where I work . Looks to be in his mid to late 20 's .From day one I liked you a lot . Maybe I got swept up by your lies . You said everything I needed to hear . You wanted to be my bf . You told me this was exclusive . So with all that , why do you message girls on those dating sites ? Why send emails to girls off craigslist ? Yes I know you like both guys and girls but that shit hurts. To say I am not as attractive as you crushed my heart . But I said fuck it . Give it a try still . Our relationship is new . Now I know you delete most of your evidence so I wo n't see and catch you . It 's very obvious because of the gaps in the conversation. No way with the amount you text that there is only so few lines of text in your inbox . I also know that you probably wo n't have sex with me unless there is a girl involved . I might have been open to that before all this but now I do n't want to do anything nice for you. You love attention . seems to me that dating me was a ploy to intice girls to `` convert you . It makes so much sense now . Be honest with me . I already know anyways . If you rather be with a girl then grow balls and tell me instead of draggin me around for months . I 'm just tired of lies and your being mia. Hey I tried to message you and you messaged back but I never followed through , if you 're still looking for someone to chat with let me know . I hope you can see this. We talked at the Sauna this Sunday afternoon and a bit at the showers. I would like to keep talking. You are white and have very nice hair. Just in case you respond , please let me know what you were wearing at the sauna. I hope to hear from you . Come to my window-I 'll be home soon . I keep dreaming about you . every night you enter my unconcious . You 're my god-my diety ! I want you so badly . My pains and hurts should never be shared with you . I only want you to see the happy , good sides . I hope this bleeding will fade away soon . I went to go try on bridesmaid dresses the other day . I absolutely hated it . Maybe I 'm just too jealous for my own good . It 's so ugly . My future sister in law was trying on a wedding gown . but I kept feeling this lust of an older 50 something lady . She was trying on a gorgeous blue wedding gown . I kept looking at her with envy . She was buying this shade of periwinkle blue because it was her fiancés favorite color . Why did this make me think of you ? In every way it did . I just want to please you , and be the one that makes you happy . I just wish I was n't so destructive . And I dream of getting to sleep with you . And do you want this too ? I 'm just such a devoted little girl and this is so hard sometimes . Anyway , I want to sleep with you , farts and all . Actually I would probably just buy you some gas-x . I want to be with you so much ! I love you baby ! ! Your lover girl . Anna , you were our server at the saturday 6:15 showing of Mad Max . You are very cute . You approached me at the bar- said you 're a Yankee . I was in a tan dress with wavy brown hair . We talked about how you moved here not long ago and I mentioned I was with a group of work friends . You came and met them all and you seemed like a really fun guy . You left for a moment to grab a friend , and when you did our group decided to relocate . I did a few laps in the bar to look for you but to no success . I 'm bummed we did n't get to talk more , and I definitely did n't want you to think I ditched . Where are you Jeff ? ? You are beautiful . I think you are into me too . As long as you avoid me , I will not think about you and you will not think about me . Hello hola ! We were at Barton late in the afternoon on Saturday . You were alone , dark skin , big hair ... and I was was my two roomies who were topless , I 'm tall thin with turquoise swimsuit Longshot posting here , but worth it : ) lets have sunday funday . You were down on the water on tubes with your two friends . I was down there with my friend . We talked twice , once in the water and once when you and your friends got out . I think you are gorgeous and would love to get together for some music and or food sometime ! You were wearing a flower swimsuit . If you are the girl I am talking about , tell me what kind of swimsuit I was wearing. you : red/black windows down . I enjoyed the glances at you until you exited at Hutto . Had you wanted me to pull over ... imagine . If interested after all , reply with letters in tag or my description . Sat night did the austin naked bike ride and was throwing it out there to see if anyone was trying to track down anyone . I was with one of my buddies and had a red backpack on . Interested ? You were on the phone arguing with a guy whose name starts with L. Thought you were really cute and wanted to buy you a beer . Young gay guy who lived next to me in an apartment building in northwest austin : You- blonde , you have a room mate/boyfriend , but caught you kissing and hugging on a young skinny white guy on your balcony a few times . I could see you from my living room window and it actually turned me on . Wish you guys would have taken it further . Me- White , youngish dad across from you , I moved out a few weeks ago . I would love to watch you two . You 're both very cute boys . What apartment building did we live in ? To the nurse that treated me in the ER early Friday morning , Thank you for everything . You were very nice to me ! Saturday afternoon while running at Townlake we made eye contact and you acknowledged . I was running alone , you were with several other guys , maybe 3 or 4 others , not sure You have short blond hair , 20 to 30 something , and nodded your head up an down when we made eye contact . You always park your fancy car in the parking garage by my balcony and you live in the other bldg . Your always looking in my apt ! Curious or just nosey ? I hope your wondering so we can take this to another level ! Hit me up . I think your hot ! What kind of car do you drive ? Talk to me ... I need to talk to you . Okay ? I know you care. Its almost like I am trapped in a poster paradoxical poster . wtf sos jk nk and yes you can make me cry and did . that was f***ed up . Hi Dakota , We spoke twice tonight briefly and I made a super poor first impression . The first time we spoke you told me I looked lost and you were super sweet . I got so nervous I declined your drink offer and went outside for 15 minutes until my friend arrived . I am not used to being approached and you were really cute . I have been out of the dating game for 2 years and am clueless . Not that you were looking for a date or anything more than a friendly conversation ... my inner introvert just had to jet . When my friend arrived I told him about how we met briefly and I blew it by running away . I was too nervous to approach you again . I do n't have a boyfriend , but am dealing with some turmoil from a breakup just over 2 weeks ago and tonight was my first night out in the world . The night got weird and I got a little too comfortable with my friend and I think you thought I was lying about our relationship being more than friends . I was n't , though tonight it did seem to broach on being a little too touchy feely . In any case , I am sorry . I know there is a 1 in a million chance you will see this . I do n't usually go to the bar scene because I get anxious . You were sweet and put me at ease . I know you do n't live here so it does n't matter anyways . I just feel bad for how I came across and wanted to let you know that I thought you seemed so nice and did n't deserve all my weirdness . Hope you have a fun weekend ! Please write me if by chance you see this ... take care ! Are you heartbroken over a guy who does n't care about you ? Wan na know how to move on ? Find a beautiful man . Let him fuck you until you can barely breathe . Then look at a picture of that jerk who treated you so bad . I am 100 % sure you will say `` WHAT THE HECK WAS I THINKING ? ? ? ! ! ! Move on , ladies . Someone will treat you like the queen you are and that prince you thought you had will turn back into the frog he really is . We talked about how it was growing up . I know one thing that makes you happy . I 'd like to know what else makes you happy . This is a long shot but maybe you 'll see this . I helped you today at my job , we talked about video games , and a few other things . You 're very pretty and you have an amazing smile . You wear glasses as well . Your name started with a K. Put my name in the subject line so I know it 's you . Spoke briefly about my tattoos & amp ; I did n't catch your name or number . Sorry , I was distracted and did n't think about it till later . I 'd like to hang out if you see this . This is probably a long shot but I felt we made some serious eye contact at the circle K on Cypress Creek and Bell in Cedar Park . On the highly unlikely chance you see me let me know what you were buying so I know it 's you . If you happen to want to explore some man on man fun on the DL let me know . believe what you want , believe what you want ... this is n't over this is n't done and my lips wo n't be sealed until I am dead All I know is you do n't know.. a lot and its not right and its our faults but so hard to sit here and not be able to say things to the love of my life . That wo n't change for me . Maybe for you it will I know . Such a shame . Its so much bigger . For me I know theres nothing no one bigger in my life now or ever . Its not pity me dramatic ; its just a fact even if I just turn into an old crone herding goats.I ca n't know where you are in your head but I know what was felt . Even the last time you touched me to steady me from falling . That touch was electric . Every day . I love you. so its like you vanished from earth . no txt or anything . no hint of where you are or what you doing at . like now the present moment . but one thing you forgot . and you left it with me . is all your love . yeah i ll say it . it dragged me here . to look for 4 you . and see if you re there somewhere . reading this . if you do my baby girl . well dont laugh bc you know it . you left it with a purpose . and that is me following it . whatever it is and anywhere you are . i got ta reach it i let it kno . you forgot it knowing one thing . that . love talks , love whispers , like a snitch haha , love sees , love guides , and love hears . hell , love makes miracles and muffins and cheesecakes haha . i play the crazy role , i say i listen to it , speak to it , think of it . and be for it . when in the real life is not there , that what they say . even enjoyin it . bc is a no manz talk . i see the need for it in the wordz everyone speaks . that why i feel the need to spread it also . with wordz . and it makes it fun . love is needed everywhere . in the street , in the church , in the internet , in science , in maths , in politics , in the music . is fkn even needed in the air . now i dont kno if you want me to stop doing it or feeling it . its like diggin a place for it deep in the universe , leavin it in every star , in every sun , every moon , every planet , and here in earth leavin it as the fuel for us mortals to advance , to live better , to evolve . feedin the soul with it . what a better ship that our soul . if we , re a match but it can not happen in this life , who gives a `` . life is f d up already time is like a tickin bomb and makes everyone freak out thinking it gon na explode . but no it never does . love is so big that even controls the time . it whispers `` time doesnt exist . you are love you are the whisper in me ! My buddy and I sat in your area yesterday evening ( Wednesday 06/03 ) . We made eye contact quite a few times and I smiled at you a few other times as well . You 're really cute . Respond with your name and something specific about yesterday . Talked a few weeks ago in chat but you have n't followed me . If you see this message me here or follow me or message me here . I was stuck in traffic behind you . Thanks for giving me something nice to look at : ) Hang out sometime ? Reply with what we were both doing while driving & amp ; what kind of car you drive . I miss you . I want you . But it does n't work . Your anger , my anxiety ... I love you . There was too much going on for us to even have a chance . There were a few moments that were simply amazing , making meat loaf , chillin at your house with the kids playing . Given a real chance , I think we would be awesome . I do n't see that happening though . There 's just too much in your life ... Too much in mine . And neither of us have the patience or time to really give us the chance. But I will always wonder what could have been . I will always love you , despite the bullshit . There 's something about you , I 've been drawn to you ever since we met . I 've never been able to understand why you get under my skin so much . I hope the best for you , I really do . I hope one day maybe we will be friends and we can chill. Take care of yourself and your boys . Anyways , happy birthday . Do not contact me about other services , products or commercial interests . You are right . I do like you but I never said anything due to our situations. Things have changed so lets talk . I can stop by the executive if you want . Let me know . You really captured my attention some time ago , and I guess I have n't tried hard enough to get to know you better . I have tried . But I still do n't have your number and you have no clue who I am . I 'd like to change that because you have this vibe that I get all antsy about , but I do n't know when I will get the chance to see you again since Osio is being remodeled . You came to my work ... drove a truck ... I think you were picking up a pizza for your mother . I could n't stop looking at your piercings . I really enjoyed watching you walk to the door . I 'd love to talk with you , maybe get together. You 're the only one who understands me , it takes so much for me to keep myself from calling you when things get hard . Or sometimes just to talk to you . Had I the courage , I would have told you how I felt . But I did n't want to ruin what we have . You give me so much hope , even when everything feels dark . In the darkness , the thought of you gave me strength . You are wonderful , do n't ever change is a drug you fein it you crave it it destroys you it builds you up Love does a hell of a lot of things to people it drives them crazy it bends them backwards trying to figure the other person out Sometimes love can be demanding Frightening Scary It can also be easy it can be simple it can be peaceful and serene Love can be tricky it can be a handful but its beautiful Blame can be a part of love when things go wrong Forgiveness comes along and wipes it all away Learn from it , do n't blame Just learn It always takes two people to tango with love Mistakes will be made Have an open heart an open mind Forgive Love needs care and patience , understanding and time You can not force love It happens over time Those are some mistakes I made , trying to force things . But what do you do when you feel like you two have put so much time into all of this , writing for years , going through the thick and thin , and still you are n't together . Your hope starts to come to a demise . Your motivation to get up in the morning fades away . You become bottomless . Emotionless . With nothing but the thought of the other constantly filling your head . Your thoughts are blurred , you do n't know what to say . The love remains but the words are out of sight . There are sparse and few but sometimes it does n't need to be spoken with a thousand words . Does n't I love you mean something anymore ? Or has those words been outplayed and outused but the common known douchebags around us . Taking those words and using them to go fuck something . When I said I love you , when I spoke from my heart . I meant every word . I love you . Last night at Shangrila around 11pm , you called the pool table after me and my friend were done . Usually , I would have struck up a more in depth conversation to further inquire about you , but we were having a kind of girl power 'no sir ' inspired night . Guess I just liked the way you dressed and how friendly you seemed even though we seemingly dismissed your excitement over hearing Bruce Springstein 's name from our corner of the room . I 'm not looking for anything in particular , I think I 'm just bored and entertaining my curiosity about what kinds of music and philosophies you 're into . That and what are the odds this post got to you . Ca n't deny a good serendipitous experiment . ( if you are not the person I described- do not respond to this post ) damn you have the most amazing eyes I HAVE EVER looked at. its like looking into Marceles ' Wallaces ' suitcase kinda ... Why did you abandon us ? Is it because some of the virtual harem members misbehave ? Seriously ladies ! Please , please conduct yourselves properly ! please , call me . Just talk to me . Or type me a few lines . I 'm not dead . If I could feel it I would and not feel this but I 'm not letting go . I ca n't . I will write to you for 50 years with no response . Just so you know you 're the only one in my heart . You caught me tongue-tied today , you tall drink of water . I was the dark-haired bearded guy in gingham that came into TJ 's today with a blond friend of mine . I made some baloney excuses to circle the store to sneak one more glance . I 'd much rather take you out for stimulating conversation . First topic : your amazing tattoo . We can discuss geo-politics or current literary trends after that ; ) . Hoping this bottle hits your shimmering shores . You waited on my table for 2 . I had the sandwich my business associate had the pizza . We also screwed up an Ice Tea. If you remember me and would like to chat and have some fun let me know. I come in every morning for breakfast and see you . We have talked a few times . You are a sexy Latina . I know you come in early and probably get off early.. would love to cuddle with you on the couch while it rains . Lets chat . I have seen you the few times I have been in the office . I always seem to get you when I am in line . Not sure if you are married , or attached . Would love to have a drink or dinner if you are free . You look like your in your mid 20s , pregnant , petite . I 've seen you few times and ca n't help but look . Your very pretty , you may have notice me a few times , but not sure . Your man is very lucky to have you . I hope he gives you the attention you deserve . Tattoo on your wrist . Cali . SLO . You 're curious . I can see something stirring in you . Bigger picture . Who am I ? We work together . Both have worked at company for years . Your few years younger than me . We both have partners and lives outside work , however I have always thought about you and wanted to have a side relationship But not risk our current situations . Your name starts with a J , we work south ... You 're a total contradiction and I am really into it . I had no idea how well we would mesh in the bedroom . I wish time would have stood still so I could enjoy you against me longer . I know things are complicated , but I will definitely enjoy the ride while it lasts . I am sure you will know this is for you because of your conceited ways ; ) You 're the guy that works at runtex . Dirty blond hair , very athletic , surfer looking guy . You 're so hot. I know you 're married and probably would never run into this but in case someone forwards it , you 're very good looking , in addition to hot : - ) You were wearing black pants and a pink shirt , you made small talk in the check out line . You looked very sexy this morning ! If you see this maybe we can grab coffee sometime ? I 've never met you , except in my dream last night . I do n't think I 've ever even seen you before , except in my dream last night . But in it my cousin and I crashed your class as you were deriving some thermodynamics on the chalk board . You noticed me and I noticed you and after the class you came up to me and were very sweet . It felt more real than fantasy the way you put your arm around me . I ca n't remember what we talked about , or what your name was , but in my memory you were about 5'7 , dark hair , and darker skin ( a tan white guy ? A Latino ? ) . I was n't going to post anything until a friend and I just talked -- we shared a very similar dream a few nights ago . Did you dream of me last night ? Do you remember me ? I know I sound insane , and maybe I am , but anyways you 'd have to be insane to answer me . The only people for me are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be saved , desirous of everything at the same time , the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars . TO Chris , fellow coconut . We met here on CL , it was still cold outside . Then we met in person at a Starbucks . You said I was a coconut like you . I 'm glad things are over . I do n't have regrets . But I am so glad what we had is over . I know you are done with me . I just wanted to say , I am sorry for hurting you . It was fun while it lasted . But because you did n't trust me , lead me to end things with you . FYI , you 're not `` Vegas ... You were suppose to be my friend . I protected you to the very end ! ! He has NO idea who you are ! ! ! But you were so easily able to THROW ME to the DOGS because you did n't trust me . I trusted you too much I guess . That is why I am so glad I ended things . You were so ready to hurt me , use words and threats and lies to hurt me and make me do what you wanted . I am so glad I ended our friendship . I do n't regret the time we had together because I had so much fun ! ! Dinner and drinking and conversation was a blast . I miss that the most . And you spoiling me . I miss that too ! I am sorry for causing you any hurt , which I am sure you will tell me `` you do n't hurt , you do n't feel ... After what we had , I guess I hoped you did feel a little something . But you accused me of something that was totally untrue and very hurtful . And because of that . I ended it . Because of how you threaten me so easily , I had to end it . Just so you know , he does n't know anything about you , I protected you to the very end . I wish you all the best in life . Have fun working on your many `` cars ... And that cool old van ! ! ! Wish I could have seen the finally product ! ! Bye Chris ! Aka Fellow Coconut ! Driving next to me on mopac dancing to this song I think . You may have noticed me looking ! : ) I do n't think it was by accident that you showed up there the other night ... If it was meant to be soon we shall see ? i do not even know at times we seem very different , at times too similiar . is it my imagination ? i am contradictory too , it is only human except i am probably worse than you maybe its better this way if we are apart we ca n't hurt each other right ? or is that the coward 's line ? Because my heart is arrested ... I fell in love with you almost 17 years ago now ... and I have n't loved anyone else . I tried and I tried but not one man makes my soul light up the way you do . I hate myself for the fear I had that day ... you were all I wanted , all I ever needed , so no ... I 'm not looking for anything serious if it is n't with you ... I 've wasted enough time trying to take a bite out of any old cookie . You 're my sugar high , my wine , my ultimate circus peanut butter taffy . I love you , as it always has been and ever will be . Me - a silver fox with a fat wallet and good looks You - long brown hair and beautiful big brown eyes , someone called you Lindsy I felt chemistry and I think you felt it too . Your smile is infectious . Let me wine and dine you and treat you like a goddess . If you are interested I will be back for the same drink order next Friday night . Black button down shirt and salt and pepper hair . I understand your silence , but will never forget how you could just turn Us off after all the years we 've been together . I will and wo n't contact you ever again . May you find your happiness and only wish the best for you . Saw you at HEB today but do n't have your number anymore . You looked amazing . Wish we could talk or hangout again . I need you . I have needed you and where have you been ? You abandoned me . I am dying and you just keep talking . You do n't respond when I 've tried to talk to you outside of here . You want to keep me in this hell . What am I waiting for , another wave as you drive by ? Im probably not even talking to you . I do n't know what I 'm doing here . I told you I wanted to leave here early on . `` The highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being . ― Tom Robbins , Jitterbug Perfume Craigslist is not responsible for making you obsessive and angry , and neither is another person . You sound like you 're having a legitimate mental health crisis , and you need to get help for that immediately . Posting 20 times a day to Craigslist to put your insanity on display to the city at large is absolutely not accomplishing anything positive. Get out of your own head , get off the computer , get into the real world , and get help . You 're communicating with strangers anonymously , you 're paranoid , you 're irrationally angry , you 're delusional , and you 're obsessed . None of this is good for you , and it 's dangerously bad for anyone foolish/afraid/hopeful enough to contact you. And for godssake , when you say you 're going to leave , LEAVE . You do n't need to update us all every half hour about how you 're really , no seriously , for real you actually mean it this time , leaving. I feel a lot of empathy for you , but holy fuck , this is not your diary , and I am tired of reading the same lunatic shit from you every day .
